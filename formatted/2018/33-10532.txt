Disclosure Update and Simplification AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Final rule.

SUMMARY: We are adopting amendments to certain of our disclosure requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”), or changes in the information environment. We are also referring certain Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. The amendments are intended to facilitate the disclosure of information to investors and simplify compliance without significantly altering the total mix of information provided to investors. These amendments are part of an initiative by the Division of Corporation Finance to review disclosure requirements applicable to issuers to consider ways to improve the requirements for the benefit of investors and issuers. We are also adopting these amendments as part of our efforts to implement title LXXII, section 72002(2) of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act.

DATES: Effective on November 5, 2018.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ryan Milne, Associate Chief Accountant, at

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is adopting amendments to, or referring to the FASB:

<END HEADER>

<h>I. Introduction and Background</h>

On July 13, 2016, the Commission proposed amendments to certain disclosure requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), or changes in the information environment. <sup>8</sup> The Commission also solicited comments on a number of disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP <sup>9</sup> to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. <sup>10</sup> Today we are adopting most of the proposed amendments substantially as proposed. In some cases, based on input from commenters, we are making modifications to the proposed amendments, and in other cases, we are not adopting the proposed amendments. In a few instances, we are adopting additional changes to our rules to make technical corrections and similar amendments identified in connection with this rulemaking. We believe the amendments will facilitate the disclosure of information to investors and simplify compliance without significantly altering the total mix of information provided to investors. <sup>11</sup> We also believe that by eliminating redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded disclosure requirements we may improve investors’ ability to make investment decisions more efficiently and reduce issuer compliance costs, which may encourage capital formation. These amendments are a result of the staff’s ongoing evaluation ofour disclosure requirements <sup>12</sup> and also are part of our efforts to implement title LXXII, section 72002(2) of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act <sup>13</sup> (the “FAST Act”).

The staff will review these amendments, including any impact on disclosure and capital formation, not later than five years after the effective date of the amendments, and report to the Commission.

<h>A. Scope of Amendments</h>

The amendments affect a variety of entities we regulate. Throughout this release, we refer to the affected entities as issuers. The requirements discussed may apply to entities other than issuers of securities or to subsets of such issuers and, thus, each requirement should be referenced for its specific scope. Entities other than issuers may include, for example, significant acquirees for which financial statements are required under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, significant equity method investments for which financial statements are required under 17 CFR 210.3-09 (“Rule 3-09” of Regulation S-X), broker-dealers, investment advisers, and nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSROs”).

<h>1. Issuers with Offerings Registered Under the Securities Act and Classes of Securities Registered Under the Exchange Act</h>

The final rule amendments affect different categories of issuers differently. Our references to domestic issuers encompass large accelerated filers, <sup>14</sup> accelerated filers, <sup>15</sup> and non-$700 million or more, as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. In addition, the issuer needs to have been subject to reporting requirements for at least twelve calendaraccelerated filers, <sup>16</sup> as well as emerging growth companies <sup>17</sup> (“EGCs”) and smaller reporting companies <sup>18</sup> (“SRCs”). In this release, we have highlighted the Commission disclosure requirements that affect SRCs differently from non-SRCs. Our references to foreign private issuers <sup>19</sup> include issuers that may be large accelerated filers, accelerated filers, or non- accelerated filers, as well as EGCs. <sup>20</sup> Specifically:months, have filed at least one annual report, and not be eligible to use the requirements for smaller reporting companies for its annual and quarterly reports.

On June 28, 2018, the Commission adopted amendments to the SRC definition. Under the amended rules, a company with a public float of less than $250 million will qualify as a SRC. A company with no public float or with a public float of less than $700 million will qualify as a SRC if it had annual revenues of less than $100 million during its most recently completed fiscal year. See Amendments to Smaller Reporting Company Definition , Release No. 33-10513 (Jun. 28, 2018) [83 FR 31992 (July 10, 2018)]. The rules willbe effective September 10, 2018.

U.S. GAAP. See Rule 8-01 of Regulation S-X. The amendments affect these SRCs in the same ways as domestic SRC issuers.

Amendments involving Regulation S-K relate to domestic issuers <sup>21</sup> and foreign private issuers that elect to file on forms used by domestic issuers.

Amendments involving Regulation S-X generally relate to domestic issuers and foreign private issuers that report under U.S. GAAP or a comprehensive body of accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP or IFRS <sup>22</sup> with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. <sup>23</sup>

Amendments involving Commission forms relate to either domestic issuers or foreign private issuers, depending on the form under discussion. For example, the amendments to the “F” series of forms <sup>24</sup> only affect foreign private issuers.

Some of the amendments also affect asset-backed issuers. <sup>25</sup>

<h>2. Issuers Offering Securities under Regulation A</h>

Some of the amendments affect Regulation A issuers, as follows: <sup>26</sup>$50 million. Rule 251(a)(1) and (2) of Regulation A.

Amendments involving Regulation S-K affect Regulation A issuers that provide narrative disclosure that follows Part I of Form S-1 or Part I of Form S-11 in Part II of Form 1-A.

Amendments involving Rule 4-10, Rule 8-04, Rule 8-05, and Rule 8-06 of Regulation S-X affect all Regulation A issuers. Amendments involving Rule 8-03(a) of Regulation S-X affect Regulation A issuers that report under U.S. GAAP. Amendments involving the remaining rules in 17 CFR 210.8-01 through 210.8-08 (“Article 8” of Regulation S-X) affect only Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP. No other amendments involving Regulation S-X affect Regulation A issuers.

Amendments involving Regulation A forms may affect issuers that report under U.S. GAAP or Canadian issuers that report under IFRS. <sup>27</sup>

In this release, we have highlighted the Commission disclosure requirements that affect Regulation A issuers. <sup>28</sup>

<h>3. Issuers Regulated under the Investment Company Act</h>

Certain amendments are applicable to issuers regulated under the Investment Company Act, as follows:

Amendments involving Regulation S-K affect business development companies to which the regulation applies.

Amendments involving Regulation S-X affect investment companies to which the regulation applies.

Amendments involving Investment Company Act forms may affect investment companies, depending on the form in question.

<h>4. Other Entities</h>

Certain amendments also are applicable to registered broker-dealers, investment advisers, and NRSROs.

<h>B. Comments on Objective and Scope of the Proposing Release</h>

Many commenters were generally supportive of the objective of the release. <sup>29</sup> These commenters indicated that the proposed amendments would improve the effectiveness and usefulness of the information presented to investors while also decreasing the costs of preparing that information, which would also benefit investors. Some of these commenters also identified additional redundancies and overlapping disclosures that the Commission should address. <sup>30</sup> In addition, some commenters recommended that the Commission establish a process to address future redundant, overlapping, outdated, or superseded disclosures. <sup>31</sup>

Some commenters objected to the overall objective and scope of the release to the extent it could result in the elimination of any currently required disclosures. <sup>32</sup> These commentersstated that investors want more (not less) disclosures and provided examples, such as environmental, social, and governance disclosures. <sup>33</sup> Some commenters also expressed concern that, due to the proposed amendments’ reliance on U.S. GAAP, and considering the FASB’s standard-setting projects related to disclosure framework and materiality, information that is material under the current disclosure framework would no longer be provided to investors. <sup>34</sup>

Several commenters also expressed concern about the timing of the proposal. <sup>35</sup> For example, some commenters were concerned that there was not sufficient time for the staff to consider the comments received on the Commission’s earlier concept release on disclosures required by Regulation S-K <sup>36</sup> in determining its proposals because those comments were due the same month the proposal was issued. <sup>37</sup> Other commenters were concerned that the 60-day comment period specified in the Proposing Release did not provide an adequate amount of time to fully consider and provide thoughtful, comprehensive comments. <sup>38</sup> In response to these comments, the Commission extended the comment period by 30 days. <sup>39</sup> We also note that the topics discussed in the Regulation S-K Concept Release were generally broader in scope than the relatively more discrete changes set forth in the Proposing Release.

<h>C. FASB-Related Considerations</h>

<h>1. Role of the FASB</h>

The federal securities laws set forth the Commission’s broad authority and responsibility to prescribe the methods to be followed in the preparation of accounts and the form and content of financial statements to be filed under those laws, <sup>40</sup> as well as its responsibility to ensure that investors are furnished with other information necessary for investment decisions. <sup>41</sup> To assist it in meeting this responsibility, the Commission historically has looked to private-sector standard- setting bodies to develop accounting principles and standards. <sup>42</sup> At the time of the FASB’s formation in 1973, the Commission reexamined its policy and formally recognized pronouncements of the FASB that establish and amend accounting principles and standards as “authoritative” in the absence of any contrary determination by the Commission. <sup>43</sup> The Commission concluded at that time that the expertise and resources that the private sector could offer to the process of setting accounting standards would be beneficial to investors.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 <sup>44</sup> (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) established criteria that must be met in order for the work product of an accounting standard-setting body to be recognized as “generally accepted” for purposes of the federal securities laws. <sup>45</sup> In accordance with these criteria, the Commission has designated the FASB as the private-sector accounting standard

Release No. 33-8221 (Apr. 25, 2003) [68 FR 23333 May 1, 2003], (“2003 FASB Policy Statement”).setter for U.S. financial reporting purposes. <sup>46</sup> As the designated private-sector accounting standard setter in the United States, the FASB seeks to undertake a transparent, public standard- setting process. <sup>47</sup> As required under the securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission monitors the FASB’s ongoing compliance with the expectations and views expressed in the 2003 FASB Policy Statement. <sup>48</sup>

<h>2. Interaction of Commission Disclosure Requirements and U.S. GAAP</h>

<h>a. Overview</h>

Although the FASB functions as the designated private-sector accounting standard setter in the United States, some Commission rules contain accounting and disclosure requirements. In some cases, these Commission requirements mandate disclosures that the FASB later added to

U.S. GAAP. <sup>49</sup> Other Commission disclosure requirements have been superseded by U.S. GAAP. <sup>50</sup> From time to time, the Commission has reviewed and amended its disclosure

See https:// www.sec.gov/rules/policy/33-8221.htm .requirements to eliminate rules that became redundant, duplicative, or overlapping as the FASB updated U.S. GAAP. <sup>51</sup> In keeping with this historical practice, many of the amendments we are adopting revise or eliminate Commission disclosure requirements related to information that is addressed by more recently updated U.S. GAAP requirements.

A number of Commission disclosure requirements require information that is incremental to U.S. GAAP rather than being duplicative or overlapping. In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comment on certain of these incremental Commission disclosure requirements to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

<h>b. Comments on Interaction of Commission Disclosure Requirements and U.S. GAAP</h>

Several commenters generally supported the referral of certain Commission disclosure requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. <sup>52</sup> These commenters were supportive of a disclosure regime that can be consistently applied to all issuers and indicated that it is beneficial to limit the sources of financial disclosure requirements. In expressing support for a consistently applied disclosure regime, some of these commenters also indicated that having different financial reporting requirements <sup>53</sup> based on the size of the issuermay eliminate information that is material to investors and may make preparation of financial statements as well as analysis of various issuers’ financial statements more difficult. <sup>54</sup>

Some commenters expressed concern about placing more reliance on U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements without more formal Commission input or approval in the FASB standard-setting process. <sup>55</sup> One commenter expressed concern about relying on the FASB to develop or require financial disclosures that might be considered appropriate for issuers but not other entities that apply U.S. GAAP. <sup>56</sup> This commenter stated that such an approach could result in “unnecessarily costly” disclosure by entities that are not issuers.

<h>c. Final Amendments</h>

We have determined to retain these incremental requirements and refer some of them to the FASB for its consideration of whether to incorporate such disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP <sup>57</sup> as part of its standard-setting process. <sup>58</sup> The discussions in this Section, as well as Sections II.B, III.B, and III.D, constitute our referral to the FASB. <sup>59</sup>

Any incorporation of these incremental Commission disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP could potentially affect all entities that prepare financial statements under U.S. GAAP, including those outside the scope of our regulatory authority. Because U.S. GAAP historically has scaled disclosure requirements only by public business entities versus other entities, and not by issuer status, incorporation into U.S. GAAP could result in the application of some of these requirements to SRCs and issuers relying on Regulation A or Regulation Crowdfunding.

By April 4, 2020, we request that the FASB complete its process to determine whether the referred disclosure items will be added to its agenda of projects for potential standard- setting. <sup>60</sup> The FASB will determine whether and, if so, how to respond to our referrals. <sup>61</sup> In the meantime, we are retaining these disclosure requirements as suggested by commenters. Any future consideration of amendments to these disclosure requirements will take into account the outcome of the standard-setting activities undertaken by the FASB, if any, in response to the referrals we are making.

<h>3. Current FASB Projects Concerning the Application of U.S. GAAP</h>

The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), which is subject to oversight by the IFRS Foundation, is responsible for IFRS and establishes its own standard-setting agenda. The staff monitors and participates in the IASB’s standard setting activities. In connection with such participation, staff will seek to discuss this rulemaking with the IASB’s staff. For further information, see http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/Pages/IFRS-Foundation-and-IASB.aspx .

The FASB updates U.S. GAAP from time to time through its standard-setting projects. In the Proposing Release, the Commission invited commenters to consider two projects on the FASB’s agenda when evaluating the proposals and providing feedback. In one project, the FASB proposed changes to U.S. GAAP <sup>62</sup> to describe how entities would assess whether disclosures are material <sup>63</sup> and included a proposal to revise U.S. GAAP to include a reference to materiality as a legal concept. <sup>64</sup> In another project, the FASB undertook to evaluate disclosure requirements for interim reporting. <sup>65</sup> In that project, the FASB has reached a tentative decision that disclosures about matters required to be provided in annual financial statements should be updated in the interim report if there is a substantial likelihood that the updated information would be viewed by a reasonable investor as significantly altering the total mix of information available to the investor. <sup>66</sup>

These FASB projects were, and the interim reporting project remains, subject to public comment and FASB deliberation and could impact those disclosure requirements we have decided to eliminate or revise on the basis that U.S. GAAP requires the same or similar

See also Minutes from FASB Board Meeting (May 29, 2014), available at: http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/FASBContent_C/ProjectUpdatePage&cid=1176164227056.disclosure. In particular, for Commission rules that contain a specified disclosure threshold, investors may receive less information if the disclosure requirement is incorporated into U.S. GAAP and the issuer determines that the information is not material. Throughout the Proposing Release, the Commission identified disclosure requirements that contemplate a disclosure threshold in some manner, for example, through the use of terms such as “material” or “significant” or through the use of bright line disclosure thresholds.

Several commenters expressed concern about the interaction between the current FASB projects and the proposed amendments. <sup>67</sup> Prior to the FASB’s decision on materiality discussed below, some commenters submitted comment letters opposing reliance on U.S. GAAP as a basis to eliminate redundant or overlapping disclosure requirements, citing the FASB’s potential change in its definition of materiality as the main reason for this opposition. One of these commenters also expressed concern that the FASB’s materiality project could remove the phrase “an entity shall at a minimum provide” from several of the U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements referenced in the Proposing Release. <sup>68</sup> Other commenters stated that the FASB’s disclosure framework projects <sup>69</sup> would not have a significant effect on the proposed amendments, provided that definitions of materiality applied by the Commission and the FASB remain consistent. <sup>70</sup> Several commenters were supportive of interim disclosure requirements and supported the FASB’s tentative decision. <sup>71</sup>

After the end of the comment period for the Proposing Release, the FASB concluded deliberations on a number of matters. For instance, in March 2018, the FASB decided not to amend U.S. GAAP to include a definition of materiality and also not to amend the disclosure sections currently in U.S. GAAP. <sup>72</sup> The FASB also made decisions related to FASB Concepts Statement No. 8. The FASB Concepts Statements are not U.S. GAAP; rather, the FASB Concepts Statements collectively compose the FASB’s Conceptual Framework, which sets forth general principles to aid the FASB in identifying factors to be considered when setting disclosure requirements for individual accounting standards and evaluating existing disclosure requirements. <sup>73</sup> Among the decisions from March, the FASB will revise the concept of materiality included in the Conceptual Framework to clarify that the definition that was previously contained in FASB Concepts Statement No. 2, <sup>74</sup> which is also the definition quoted in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, <sup>75</sup> is the definition to be used by the FASB when it considers and formulates its standard setting projects. We believe these decisions by the FASB have clarified that the concept of materiality has not changed from the historical view of how an issuer applies materiality to the financial statements.

We believe the FASB’s decision not to amend U.S. GAAP to include a definition of materiality, as well as the decisions related to FASB Concepts Statement No. 8, substantially address the concerns expressed by commenters about the impact of the current FASB standard-http://fasb.org/jsp/FASB/FASBContent_C/ProjectUpdatePage&cid=1176163077030.https:// www.sec.gov/interps/account/sab99.htm .setting projects. As a result of these decisions, we believe there will not be changes to how an issuer applies the concept of materiality to its financial statements, including the related notes. We are therefore eliminating certain of our disclosure requirements, as proposed, on the basis that U.S. GAAP requires the same or similar disclosures. <sup>76</sup> In addition, issuers remain liable for their disclosures, including the omission of any information required to make the disclosures not misleading. <sup>77</sup> Issuers should continue to consider both quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing materiality for the accounting and disclosure of an item, and also should continue to consider whether they have made critical accounting estimates and assumptions for which disclosure should be provided in MD&A. <sup>78</sup> Further, U.S. GAAP requires a description of an issuer’s significant accounting policies. <sup>79</sup>

<h>D. Disclosure Location Considerations</h>

<h>a. Overview</h>

In some cases, our amendments result in the relocation of disclosures within a filing, <sup>80</sup>with the following consequences:

Prominence Considerations – the current location of some disclosures may provide a certain level of prominence and/or context to other disclosures located with them. Therelocation of these disclosures may change the prominence and/or context of both the relocated disclosures and the remaining disclosures. We refer to these consequences collectively as “Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations.”

Financial Statement Considerations – the amendments related to some topics result in the relocation of disclosures from outside to inside the financial statements, subjecting this information to annual audit and/or interim review, internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”), and XBRL tagging requirements, as applicable. The safe harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”) would not be available for such disclosures. <sup>81</sup> Conversely, relocation of disclosures from inside to outside the financial statements would have the opposite effect – namely, this information would not be subject to annual audit and/or interim review, ICFR, and XBRL tagging requirements, as applicable, while the safe harbor under the PSLRA would be available. These topics would also be subject to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations. We refer to these consequences collectively as “Disclosure Location – Financial Statement Considerations.”

Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations – some overlapping requirements, while similar, are not redundant or duplicative because one set of requirements includes a bright line disclosure threshold, while the other set of requirements does not. <sup>82</sup> Where a requirement contains a bright line disclosure threshold, matters involving amounts below that threshold are not required to be disclosed. With the exception of disclosure

III.E.13 of the Proposing Release, supra note 1, at 51632. The corresponding U.S. GAAP requirements do not contain such bright line disclosure thresholds.requirements about major customers, the Commission disclosure requirements we discuss contain bright line disclosure thresholds, while the corresponding U.S. GAAP requirements do not. For these topics, the elimination of the bright line threshold would potentially change the disclosure provided to investors. We refer to these considerations collectively as “Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.”

<h>b. Comments on Disclosure Location Considerations</h>

Some commenters indicated that, due to the emergence of electronic data analysis and search tools, investors and other users are generally placing less emphasis on disclosure location. <sup>83</sup> Views were mixed on relocating disclosures into the financial statements. Some commenters stated that they prefer most financial disclosures to be within the financial statements given the audit requirement and ICFR, <sup>84</sup> while others opposed relocation for these same reasons. <sup>85</sup> Numerous commenters also expressed concern about moving disclosures that contain forward-looking information into the financial statements. These commenters noted that such relocation would introduce liability concerns for registrants because the safe harbor under PSLRA would no longer apply and could create potential verification and auditability issues for auditors. <sup>86</sup> Other commenters also expressed concern that it could result in loss of information that may currently be provided by registrants voluntarily. <sup>87</sup>

Some commenters opposed eliminating any bright line thresholds in Commission disclosure requirements because the thresholds establish a baseline of disclosure for allregistrants in certain areas. <sup>88</sup> These commenters expressed concern about using a materiality standard for disclosure because it may reduce the information made available to investors or diminish comparability of registrants. Other commenters were supportive of eliminating the bright line thresholds, especially the thresholds discussed in the Proposing Release, and generally supported a more principles-based disclosure framework. <sup>89</sup> These commenters also indicated that materiality is a better disclosure standard because certain of the existing bright line thresholds result in disclosure that, in their view, is immaterial to investors and costly to provide.

<h>c. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting the majority of the proposed amendments that were identified with Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations or Financial Statement Considerations because (a) commenters were supportive of the amendment and did not express concern with the relocation of the disclosure; or (b) the overlapping U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements, identified in the Proposing Release, are already subject to audit and ICFR requirements. <sup>90</sup> We also are amending one disclosure requirement identified with Bright Line Disclosure Thresholds Considerations relating to restrictions on dividends as proposed. <sup>91</sup> We are not adopting other

III.B.1.c Research and Development Activities ; Section III.B.1.d Warrants, Rights, and Convertible Instruments ; Section III.C.2 R estrictions on Dividends and Related Items ; Section III.C.3 Geographic Areas ; Section III.D.3 Major Customers ; Section III.D.5 Products and Services ; and Section V.B.2 Dividends Per Share in Interim Financial Statements. We are not adopting any requirements to disclose forward-looking information in a registrant’s financial statements.proposed amendments due to concern about the relocation of the disclosure and possible loss of forward-looking and voluntary information. In addition, we are referring some of the disclosure requirements with Disclosure Location or Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

<h>II. Redundant or Duplicative Requirements</h>

<h>A. Background</h>

In the Proposing Release, the Commission identified a number of disclosure requirements that require substantially similar disclosures as U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements. The Commission proposed to eliminate these redundant or duplicative Commission disclosure requirements to simplify issuer compliance efforts in light of the obligation to provide substantially the same information to investors under other requirements.

<h>B. Redundant or Duplicative Disclosure Requirements with U.S. GAAP</h>

<h>1. Foreign Currencies</h>

Rule 3-20 of Regulation S-X describes the currency requirements for financial statements of foreign private issuers. The third sentence of Rule 3-20(d) of Regulation S-X provides the definition of “the currency of an operation’s primary economic environment” and “a hyperinflationary environment.” The Commission proposed to eliminate these definitions because U.S. GAAP provides substantially the same definitions. <sup>92</sup>

While most commenters <sup>93</sup> supported the elimination, two commenters <sup>94</sup> recommended that the Commission retain these provisions. These commenters indicated that while thedefinitions are the same in the Commission disclosure requirement and U.S. GAAP, the definition in U.S. GAAP <sup>95</sup> can be interpreted to apply only to a subsidiary, division, branch or joint venture of the issuer rather than the issuer itself, whereas Rule 3-20(d) applies to both the issuer and each of its material operations. <sup>96</sup>

After further consideration and in light of concerns raised about whether Rule 3-20(d) and U.S. GAAP are duplicative, we are retaining the definitions in the current rule and referring the issue to the FASB for potential clarification in U.S. GAAP.

<h>2. Other</h>

The Commission proposed to eliminate a number of other requirements that are substantially redundant or duplicative of U.S. GAAP disclosures. The table below describes each of these requirements and identifies the corresponding U.S. GAAP requirement. <sup>97</sup> For the Commission disclosure requirements proposed for elimination that apply to foreign private issuers that report using IFRS, we identify the corresponding IFRS requirement. <sup>98</sup>

Commenters generally supported these proposed amendments due to the redundant or duplicative nature of the Commission disclosure requirements with U.S. GAAP and IFRS, <sup>113</sup> and no commenter specifically opposed the amendments. We are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed.

<h>C. Redundant or Duplicative Disclosure Requirements with Other Commission Requirements</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

In the Proposing Release, the Commission identified disclosure requirements that are redundant or duplicative of other Commission requirements. In most of these cases, the rule or item proposed to be eliminated is a reference to another Commission requirement and elimination would not affect compliance with the underlying requirement. The table below describes each proposed amendment.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters generally supported these proposed amendments. <sup>118</sup> One commenter recommended retaining the last sentence of Rule 3-20(d) of Regulation S-X without providing further explanation. <sup>119</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting the other amendments as proposed, with one exception. After additional analysis, we are not adopting the proposed elimination of the last sentence in Rule 3-20(d) because it relates to a small population of issuers (i.e. foreign private issuers that do not apply either U.S. GAAP or IFRS) and to avoid any unintended consequences in light of a commenter’s recommendation. Additionally, the amendments eliminate a redundant requirement in Instruction 3 to Item 504 of Regulation S-K that was identified subsequent to the proposal. <sup>120</sup>

<h>III. Overlapping Requirements</h>

<h>A. Background</h>

In the Proposing Release, the Commission identified disclosure requirements that are related to, but not the same as, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements, which we refer to in this release as overlapping requirements. The Commission proposed the following related to these requirements:

Delete disclosure requirements that: (1) require disclosures that convey reasonably similar information to or are encompassed by the disclosures that result from compliance with the overlapping U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or Commission disclosure requirements; or (2) require disclosures incremental to the overlapping U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or Commission disclosure requirements and may no longer be useful to investors.

Integrate Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, other Commission disclosure requirements.

The Commission also solicited comment on certain Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

<h>B. Overlapping Requirements - Proposed Deletions</h>

<h>1. Overlapping Disclosure Requirements with U.S. GAAP</h>

The Proposing Release identified several disclosure requirements that the Commission believed to be overlapping with U.S. GAAP.

<h>a. Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Since the requirements in Regulation S-X governing repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements were adopted in 1986, the FASB has amended the U.S. GAAP requirements for the accounting and disclosures for repurchase agreements and similar transactions, <sup>122</sup> which has resulted in overlapping disclosure requirements. We discuss these overlapping requirements and the proposed amendments below.

<h>a. Balance Sheet Presentation</h>

Regulation S-X <sup>123</sup> and U.S. GAAP <sup>124</sup> both require separate presentation of repurchase liabilities associated with repurchase agreements on the face of the balance sheet. <sup>125</sup> Regulation

S-X, unlike U.S. GAAP, sets forth a 10 percent threshold for separate presentation. <sup>126</sup> The Commission proposed to delete the requirement for separate presentation in Rule 4-08(m)(1)(i) and the related 10 percent threshold and noted the Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations. The Commission also proposed to retain the requirement to include accrued interest payables in the separately presented liability amounts.

<h>b. Disaggregated Disclosures</h>

While Regulation S-X <sup>127</sup> and U.S. GAAP <sup>128</sup> both require disaggregated disclosures about repurchase agreements, they differ in the form and content of the disaggregated disclosures.

First, Regulation S-X and U.S. GAAP both require disaggregated disclosures of repurchase liabilities by class of collateral and maturity interval. U.S. GAAP permits an entity to determine the appropriate level of disaggregation and classes of collateral to be presented on the basis of the nature, characteristics, and risks of the collateral pledged, whereas Regulation S-X provides a few illustrative examples of classes. Regulation S-X also specifies maturity intervals (e.g., overnight, up to 30 days), whereas U.S. GAAP permits judgment to determine an appropriate range of maturity intervals. Further, Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-X requires the disaggregated disclosure to be combined in the form of a single table. Although U.S. GAAP is silent about the form of disclosure, its sole example of an approach to comply with its requirements is a single table that includes both classes of collateral as well as maturity intervalsan opposite exchange later,” such as dollar rolls (an agreement to sell and repurchase similar but not identical securities) and securities lending transactions. See ASC 860-30-15-3.similar to those required by Regulation S-X. <sup>129</sup> Overall, U.S. GAAP permits more judgment to determine the classes to be presented, the range of maturity intervals, and the form of disclosure than Regulation S-X. <sup>130</sup>

Second, Regulation S-X specifies tabular disclosure of the carrying amount of associated assets sold under repurchase agreements disaggregated by class of asset sold and maturity interval (e.g., overnight, up to 30 days) of the repurchase agreement. <sup>131</sup> Instead of a tabular format, U.S. GAAP requires separate presentation on the transferor’s balance sheet of the carrying amount of assets that the transferee has the right to sell or repledge. <sup>132</sup> U.S. GAAP also requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of the carrying amount and balance sheet classification of both the assets pledged as collateral that the transferee does not have the right to sell or repledge and the associated liabilities, along with quantitative information about the relationship(s) between them. <sup>133</sup>

The Commission proposed to delete the identified Regulation S-X requirements because the disclosures that result from compliance with U.S. GAAP, and the accompanying disclosure objectives and aggregation principles, convey reasonably similar information as the disclosures required by Regulation S-X. <sup>134</sup>

Third, Regulation S-X requires disaggregated disclosures of the market value of assets sold under repurchase agreements for which unrealized changes in market value are reported in income. <sup>135</sup> Although the FASB deliberated adding a requirement to U.S. GAAP to disclose the market value of these assets, it ultimately decided against doing so due to operability concerns. <sup>136</sup>

Based on the foregoing, the Commission proposed to delete Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii), with the exception of the requirement in Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii)(A)(ii) to disclose the interest rate on repurchase liabilities, which the Commission would retain. Regulation S-X, unlike U.S. GAAP, sets forth a 10 percent threshold for the disaggregated disclosures; <sup>137</sup> therefore, the proposed amendments give rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.

<h>c. Collateral Policy</h>

The Commission proposed to delete the requirement in Regulation S-X <sup>138</sup> to disclose an issuer’s policy with regard to taking possession of assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements because U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the issuer’s policy for requiring collateral or other security. <sup>139</sup> Although U.S. GAAP is not as specific as Regulation S-X about takingpossession of collateral, the Commission believed Regulation S-X requires disclosures that are encompassed by the disclosures that result from compliance with U.S. GAAP.

Regulation S-X, unlike U.S. GAAP, requires these disclosures when the aggregate carrying amount of reverse repurchase agreements exceeds 10 percent of total assets. As such, the proposed amendment gives rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters were split on the proposals related to the requirements for repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. A number of commenters expressed support for the proposed amendments except for the elimination of the collateral policy disclosure requirement. <sup>140</sup> These commenters agreed that the U.S. GAAP disclosures provide reasonably similar information for the balance sheet presentation and disaggregated disclosure requirements. Certain commenters were not supportive of the deletion of the collateral policy disclosure requirements <sup>141</sup> and recommended referring the requirement to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. <sup>142</sup> These commenters stated that the disclosure provides useful information to understanding the credit risk associated with the transactions in which the issuer does not take possession of the collateral.

Several other commenters opposed the proposed amendments, expressing concern that the amendments would eliminate disclosures that are material to investors and other users of the financial statements. <sup>143</sup> For example, one of the commenters stated that the information requiredby Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii) is essential to understanding an issuers’ liabilities in the repo market. <sup>144</sup> Another commenter indicated that it cannot support the proposed revisions to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements disclosure requirements at this time, given the importance of these disclosures, the relative newness of the changes to the U.S. GAAP requirements, and the existence of differences in the form and content of the respective requirements. <sup>145</sup> One commenter also indicated that it believes repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements should be discussed in SEC filings more than just in the financial statement footnotes because they are complex financial instruments that can have a dramatic impact on the financing and liquidity of financial institutions and other businesses. <sup>146</sup>

Additionally, while one commenter explicitly supported the elimination of the 10 percent threshold in Rule 4-08(m)(1)(ii), <sup>147</sup> other commenters expressed concerns, indicating that the removal could result in less disclosure of information that is material to investors. <sup>148</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

In light of the comments about the importance of the information, we are retaining the Regulation S-X disclosure requirements related to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and referring these requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

<h>b. Derivative Accounting Policies</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Fund, Sunlight Foundation and Zevin Asset Management, LLC (Oct. 31, 2016) (“As You Sow, et. al”); CalPERS; and CII.

Regulation S-X <sup>149</sup> and U.S. GAAP <sup>150</sup> both require disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of accounting policies for certain derivative instruments. Regulation S-X applies to:

<h>1. derivative financial instruments, as defined under U.S. GAAP, and (2) derivative commodity instruments such as commodity futures, swaps, and options that are permitted to be settled in cash or with another financial instrument, to the extent such instruments are not within the definition of derivative financial instruments. For both types of instruments, Regulation S-X requires, where material, disclosure of the accounting policies; the criteria required to be met for each accounting method used; the accounting method used if those criteria are not met; the method used to account for terminations of derivatives designated as hedges or derivatives used to affect the terms, fair values, or cash flows of a designated item; the method used to account for derivatives when the designated item matures, is sold, is extinguished, or is terminated; and how the derivative instruments are reported in the financial statements.</h>

U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of accounting principles and methods that materially affect the financial statements, including those involving a selection from existing acceptable alternatives, and important judgments about the appropriateness of the principles. <sup>151</sup> In the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that it believes these U.S. GAAP principles call for reasonably similar information as the corresponding requirements in Regulation S-X, as they require disclosure of the accounting method applied to each aspect of a material derivative transaction from inception to termination.

In addition, for derivative financial instruments, as defined under U.S. GAAP, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of how and why the issuer uses derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how they affect the financial statements. <sup>152</sup> Although Regulation S-X is more detailed than U.S. GAAP, the specificity in Regulation S-X stemmed, in part, from the absence of a comprehensive accounting model for derivatives when the Commission adopted these disclosure requirements. <sup>153</sup> Since that time, the FASB has adopted an accounting model for derivative financial instruments, as defined under U.S. GAAP. <sup>154</sup> Because U.S. GAAP has a comprehensive accounting model for contracts that meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument, the Commission stated in the Proposing Release that it believes that the additional specific disclosure requirements in Rule 4-08(n) are no longer applicable.

Based on the foregoing, the Commission proposed to delete Rule 4-08(n) and Note 2(b) to Rule 8-01.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

While several commenters <sup>155</sup> supported the proposed deletion of the Regulation S-X requirements related to derivative accounting policies, two commenters <sup>156</sup> expressed concern.

One of these commenters, <sup>157</sup> while supportive of deleting the disclosure requirements, indicated that U.S. GAAP does not provide clear guidance on how to measure written options that do not meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument under U.S. GAAP. <sup>158</sup> For this reason, this commenter recommended referring this issue to the FASB for potential incorporation into

U.S. GAAP. The other commenter stated that the Commission should increase instead of decrease disclosures related to derivatives. <sup>159</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are eliminating most of the requirements in Rule 4-08(n) as proposed. However, after additional consideration, we are not eliminating the requirement to disclose where in the statement of cash flows the effect of derivative financial instruments is reported. <sup>160</sup> U.S. GAAP does not have a similar disclosure requirement. <sup>161</sup> We also are referring the statement of cash flows disclosure requirement to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. We continue to believe that the U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements and related principles <sup>162</sup> call for information that is reasonably similar to the information called for by the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-X and that some of the additional disclosure requirements in Rule 4-08(n) are no longer applicable. Finally, we are sharing the comment letters that request reviewof the disclosures for derivatives and accounting for written options with the FASB because these considerations are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. <sup>163</sup>

<h>c. Research and Development Activities</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Regulation S-K requires disclosures, if material, of the amount spent on research and development activities for all years presented. <sup>164</sup> The Commission proposed to delete this requirement because, although Regulation S-K uses terms that differ from U.S. GAAP, <sup>165</sup> U.S. GAAP requires reasonably similar disclosures.

First, Regulation S-K refers to the “amount spent,” while U.S. GAAP refers to “costs charged to expense” or “costs incurred.” The Commission release adopting this requirement used the term “expense” when discussing this requirement. <sup>166</sup>

Regulation S-K also uses the term “company-sponsored,” but U.S. GAAP does not.

However, the Regulation S-K Adopting Release specified that the amount of company-sponsored research and development expenses to be disclosed should be determined in accordance with

U.S. GAAP, suggesting no difference in scope was intended. <sup>167</sup>

In addition, Regulation S-K refers to “customer-sponsored” research and development activities, while U.S. GAAP refers to “research and development performed on behalf of others.”and to determine whether changes to U.S. GAAP are needed. The items raised by commenters here is an external source of data available for the FASB’s consideration when evaluating potential improvements to

U.S. GAAP.

Because U.S. GAAP refers to all other parties, which is broader than customers, the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP would encompass those required by Regulation S-K.

Further, Item 101(c)(1)(xi) only refers to customer-sponsored “research activities” rather than research and development activities. However, we do not believe this difference is substantive because Item 101(h)(4)(x) refers to “research and development activities” and it was intended to “parallel” Item 101(c)(1)(xi). <sup>168</sup>

Similarly, Item 5.C of Form 20-F requires foreign private issuers to describe their research and development policies, where significant, and disclose the amount spent on company-sponsored research and development activities. The Commission proposed to delete the requirement to disclose the amount spent, as foreign private issuers are already required to disclose the amount of research and development expenses in the notes to the financial statements. <sup>169</sup> In certain circumstances, IFRS requires that amounts spent on development be capitalized as an intangible asset, instead of expensed, and also disclosed. <sup>170</sup> While Commission disclosure requirements use terms different from IFRS, the Commission stated in the Proposing Release that it believes IFRS results in reasonably similar disclosures for the same reasons discussed above with regards to differences in terminology between Commission disclosure requirements and U.S. GAAP.

Form 1-A also requires Regulation A issuers to disclose, if material, the amount spent onresearch and development activities for all years presented. <sup>171</sup> As this requirement is based on the requirement in Regulation S-K, Regulation A issuers that report under either U.S. GAAP or IFRS provide substantially the same information in the notes to their financial statements, as described above.

Accordingly, the Commission proposed to delete Item 101(c)(1)(xi) of Regulation S-K and Item 101(h)(4)(x) of Regulation S-K, Item 5.C of Form 20-F, and Item 7(a)(1)(iii) of Form 1-A. The Proposing Release noted Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations, because these disclosures are located in the business description section of the filing, while the corresponding U.S. GAAP and IFRS disclosures are in the notes to the financial statements.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Most commenters were supportive of the proposed amendments. <sup>172</sup> Additionally, a commenter recommended that the Commission consider feedback from preparers and users, including feedback provided in response to the S-K Concept Release, that issuers may be less willing to voluntarily supplement the required disclosures in the notes to the financial statements with forward-looking information because note disclosures are not subject to the safe harbor under the PSLRA. This commenter indicated some registrants do voluntarily provide qualitative disclosures about research and development activities and the loss of this information may be material to a user’s understanding of the registrant’s financial statements. <sup>173</sup> Another commenter recommended also rescinding the requirement to disclose a description of a foreign private issuer’s research and development policies for the last three years in Item 5.C of Form 20-F orclarifying whether this disclosure requirement relates to accounting policies or research and development activities. <sup>174</sup>

One commenter did not support the deletion of Item 101(c)(1)(xi) and Item 101(h)(4)(x) of Regulation S-K, indicating that these disclosures, along with other disclosures required by Item 101, are necessary in assessing and understanding a company’s ability to create long-term value for shareholders. <sup>175</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting the amendments as proposed. We do not believe eliminating these requirements regarding amounts spent on research and development activities will affect the assessment and understanding of a company’s ability to create long-term value for shareholders, as this information will remain in the notes to the financial statements. In addition, disclosure of trend information related to research and development activities and expenses, where material, is required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K, <sup>176</sup> and we expect registrants to continue to provide such disclosures as necessary. Further, the proposed amendments do not preclude registrants from continuing to provide voluntary disclosures as part of the description of their business or elsewhere outside the financial statements.

We are not eliminating the requirement to disclose a description of a foreign private issuer’s research and development policies for the last three years, as one commenter suggested.

This requirement was initially adopted as part of the description of business disclosure, and it is intended to cover research and development activity rather than an accounting policy. <sup>177</sup>

<h>d. Warrants, Rights, and Convertible Instruments</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Item 201(a)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure on Form S-1 or Form 10 of the amount of common equity subject to outstanding options, warrants, or convertible securities, when the class of common equity has no established United States public trading market. U.S. GAAP more broadly requires disclosure of the terms of significant contracts to issue additional shares, the number of shares authorized for certain equity awards, <sup>178</sup> and, in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average incremental shares that would be issued from the assumed exercise or conversion of options, warrants, and convertible securities. <sup>179</sup> As such, the Commission proposed to delete Item 201(a)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K.

The Proposing Release explained that the proposed amendments give rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations because Item 201(a)(2)(i) disclosures are located with related information about the potential dilution of equity for which there is no established United States public trading market, while the U.S. GAAP disclosures are in the notes to the financial statements.815-40-50-5.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Most commenters were supportive of the proposed amendments. <sup>180</sup> One commenter opposed the amendments, stating that these requirements should not be eliminated because U.S. GAAP does not explicitly require the same information and the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K are more “straightforward.” <sup>181</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are eliminating Item 201(a)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K as proposed. We believe U.S. GAAP elicits reasonably similar information to that required by the disclosure requirement in Regulation S-K, and in some cases, would elicit information for a broader array of potentially dilutive arrangements. For example, disclosure of the existence of contingently issuable shares is not an explicit requirement in Item 201(a)(2)(i), though it is explicitly contemplated by the

U.S. GAAP requirement. <sup>182</sup>

<h>e. Equity Compensation Plans</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Regulation S-K prescribes the form and content for the disclosure of existing equity compensation plans where equity securities are authorized for issuance. <sup>183</sup> This information is currently required in Part III of Form 10-K, Item 11 of Form S-1, Item 9 of Form 10, and Item 10of Schedule 14A. <sup>184</sup> In 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS No. 123R”) , which resulted in disclosures that overlap with Item 201(d). <sup>185</sup>

Regulation S-K incrementally requires: (1) for options, warrants, or rights assumed in a business combination, disclosure of the number of securities to be issued upon exercise and the weighted-average exercise price, <sup>186</sup> and (2) disclosure of any formula for calculating the number of securities available for issuance under the plan. <sup>187</sup> Item 201(d) further provides instructions about the aggregation of equity compensation plan disclosures. Although these requirements are not explicitly contained in U.S. GAAP, the Commission stated in the Proposing Release that it believes the U.S. GAAP requirement to provide disclosures to enable investors to understand the nature and terms of equity compensation arrangements and the potential effects of those arrangements on shareholders <sup>188</sup> would result in reasonably similar disclosures.

Regulation S-K also incrementally requires disaggregation of information between equity compensation plans approved by security holders and those not approved by security holders.

The Commission adopted these requirements in 2001 <sup>189</sup> before the major national securities exchanges required listed issuers to have, with limited exceptions, shareholder approved plans. <sup>190</sup>

Because the exchanges <sup>191</sup> on which the majority of domestic issuers, representing substantially all domestic issuer market capitalization, are listed now have such requirements, the Commission stated in the Proposing Release that it believed disaggregation of the disclosures about the plans in this manner is no longer useful to investors. <sup>192</sup>

Based on the foregoing, the Commission proposed to delete Item 201(d) and the references to it in Part III of Form 10-K and Item 10(c) of Schedule 14A. These proposed amendments would not affect the disclosures related to new plans or modifications of existing plans subject to shareholder action. <sup>193</sup> Because disclosures required by Item 201(d) are located with related information about the issuer’s common equity and related stockholder matters, while the corresponding disclosures are in the notes to the financial statements, the proposed amendments give rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations. In particular, as a result of the proposed amendments, Item 201(d) disclosures would no longer be provided in Schedule 14A <sup>194</sup> alongside information on equity compensation plans subject to security holder action. Instead, investors would obtain that information from the notes to theand Nasdaq Proposed Rule Changes and Nasdaq Amendment No. 1 and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to NYSE Amendments No. 1 and 2 and Nasdaq Amendments No. 2 and 3 Thereto Relating to Equity Compensation Plans , Release No. 34-48108 (June 30, 2003) [68 FR 39995 (Jul. 3, 2003)]. See also New York Stock Exchange, Listed Company Manual § 303A.08; Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) and IM-5635-1; American Stock Exchange Rulemaking Re: Shareholder Approval of Stock Option Plans and Other Equity Compensation Arrangements , Release No. 34-48610 (Oct. 9, 2003) [68 FR 59650 (Oct. 16, 2003)]; and NYSE MKT Company Guide § 711.financial statements in the separate Form 10-K filing. With the proposed amendments, issuers may also be less willing to voluntarily supplement the required disclosures in the notes to the financial statements with forward-looking information because note disclosures are not subject to the safe harbor under the PSLRA.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Some commenters <sup>195</sup> supported the proposed amendments, but a number of commenters <sup>196</sup> opposed eliminating certain Item 201(d) disclosure requirements. Some commenters expressed concern that the proposed amendments would eliminate the requirement to disclose the number of shares available for future issuance, <sup>197</sup> which they stated is material to shareholders. <sup>198</sup> Other commenters <sup>199</sup> opposed deleting the requirement to disclose the formula for calculating the number of securities available for issuance under the equity compensation plan. <sup>200</sup> These commenters indicated that such disclosure is not likely to occur without further clarification of how the general disclosure principle in U.S. GAAP applies to the calculation, and recommended we refer this item to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. Additionally, some commenters opposed the deletion of the disaggregation disclosure requirement. <sup>201</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

After further consideration, we are retaining the equity compensation plans disclosure requirements and are referring them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. We recognize the concerns expressed by commenters that U.S. GAAP does not explicitly require certain information, such as the formula for calculating the number of securities available for issuance under the plan. This information may be material to investors in making informed decisions about the scope of an issuer’s equity compensation program and the potential dilutive effect, both economically and in voting power, of awards authorized for issuance under all equity compensation plans.

<h>f. Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Regulation S-K requires issuers that register debt securities to disclose the historical and pro forma ratios of earnings to fixed charges. <sup>202</sup> Regulation S-K also requires issuers that register preference equity securities to disclose the historical and pro forma ratio of combined fixed charges and preference dividends to earnings (collectively, “ratio of earnings to fixed charges”). <sup>203</sup> Regulation S-K further requires the filing of an exhibit setting forth the computation of any ratio of earnings to fixed charges. <sup>204</sup> Similarly, Instruction 7 to “Instructions as to Exhibits” of Form 20-F requires foreign private issuers to disclose how any ratio of earnings to fixed charges presented in the filing was calculated. U.S. GAAP and IFRS require disclosure of many of the components commonly used in this ratio (e.g., income, interest

See Item 503(e) and Item 601(c) of Regulation S-K.expense, lease expense), as well as information from which other ratios that convey reasonably similar information about an issuer’s ability to meet its financial obligations may be computed.

A variety of analytical tools are available today to investors that may accomplish a similar objective as the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. This ratio measures the issuer’s ability to service fixed financing expenses – specifically, interest expense, including management’s approximation of the portion of lease expense that represents interest expense, and preference dividend requirements – from earnings. Other ratios that accomplish similar objectives include other variations of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, <sup>205</sup> the interest coverage ratio, <sup>206</sup> and the debt-service coverage ratio, <sup>207</sup> which can be calculated based on information readily available in the financial statements. Certain components commonly used in the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, such as the portion of lease expense that represents interest <sup>208</sup> and the amortization of capitalized interest, are not readily available elsewhere. Despite this, the requirement to disclose the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, as opposed to the various components (e.g., income,interest expense, lease expense) of this ratio that investors may use as desired, may place undue emphasis on this particular measure.

Moreover, while debt agreements may contain fixed charge coverage covenants, <sup>209</sup> debt investors often negotiate contractual agreements with issuers to obtain financial information to meet their needs, <sup>210</sup> which may be more relevant and useful than a prescribed disclosure of a ratio of earnings to fixed charges. Companies are also required to discuss the material impacts of these covenants to the extent that they are reasonably likely to limit the company’s ability to undertake additional financing or are reasonably likely to be breached. <sup>211</sup>

Based on these considerations, the Commission proposed to remove the requirement to disclose the ratio of earning to fixed charges by deleting Item 503(d) and Item 601(b)(12). <sup>212</sup> The Commission also proposed to delete Instruction 7 to “Instructions as to Exhibits” of Form 20-F.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters were supportive of the proposed amendments. <sup>213</sup> One of these commenters indicated that, in its experience, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is generally not used by investors or other users of financial statements, and debt covenant financial requirements may already be disclosed where material <sup>214</sup> and vary significantly from company to company. <sup>215</sup> Another commenter, while supportive of the proposed amendments, recommended that the Commission obtain feedback from investors about the continued utility of the pro forma ratio disclosure, as information on a pro forma basis may not be as readily available. <sup>216</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting the amendments as proposed, including the elimination of the pro forma ratio. Although one commenter suggested that pro forma information may be less readily available, we note that information about the offering’s effect on fixed charges, such as the interest rate, maturities, and amount of proceeds used to discharge indebtedness, is currently required by Item 504 of Regulation S-K. <sup>217</sup>

<h>g. Other</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

The table below describes each of the remaining disclosure requirements that are overlapping with U.S. GAAP and the proposed amendments. <sup>218</sup>

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters supported these proposed amendments. <sup>227</sup> In addition, commenters identified another overlapping requirement in Regulation S-X for Registered Investment

Companies. <sup>228</sup> The commenters noted that Rule 6-09.3 of Regulation S-X requires separate disclosure of distributions paid to shareholders from (a) Investment income – net; (b) realized gain from investment transactions – net; and (c) other sources, while U.S. GAAP requires distributions paid to be disclosed as a single line item. <sup>229</sup> These commenters recommended amending Regulation S-X to align it with the requirements in U.S. GAAP.

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed. We are also amending Rule 6-09.3 of Regulation S-X, as suggested by commenters and similar to the amendments to Rule 6.04-17, to require presentation of the total, rather than the components, of distributions to shareholders, except for tax return of capital distributions . U.S. GAAP requires similar presentation of information as the Regulation S-X requirements, and the incremental requirement to separately present certain components is not useful to investors because of the unique tax status of registered investment companies.

<h>2. Other Overlapping Disclosure Requirements</h>

The Proposing Release also identified overlapping Commission disclosure requirements. These disclosure requirements and the related proposed amendments are described in the table below. <sup>230</sup>

Commenters supported the proposed amendments. <sup>235</sup> We are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed because investors will continue to receive similar information under other Commission disclosure requirements.

<h>3. Overlapping Disclosure Requirements with Both U.S. GAAP and Other Commission Disclosure Requirements</h>

The Proposing Release identified several Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with both U.S. GAAP and other Commission disclosure requirements.

<h>a. Interim Financial Statements – Pro Forma Business Combination Information</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Regulation S-X <sup>236</sup> and U.S. GAAP <sup>237</sup> both require supplemental pro forma information about business combinations in the notes to interim financial statements. These disclosure requirements differ in two ways: (1) scope and (2) the line items required to be disclosed.

Notwithstanding these differences, the Proposing Release noted that U.S. GAAP and Item 9.01 of Form 8-K <sup>238</sup> result in disclosures reasonably similar to the corresponding requirements in Regulation S-X.

Regulation S-X requires disclosure of pro forma information for “significant” business combinations for SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP and “material” business combinations for non-SRCs. U.S. GAAP, on the other hand, does not qualify the size of the business combinations to which pro forma information requirements apply. Accordingly, the requirements in U.S. GAAP apply to the same or a greater number of business combinations and, thus, subsume the scope of the corresponding requirements in Regulation S-X.

With respect to the line items required to be disclosed, Regulation S-X requires disclosure of pro forma revenue, net income, net income attributable to the issuer, and net income per share. Regulation S-X also requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP to disclose pro forma income from continuing operations.

U.S. GAAP only requires disclosure of pro forma revenue and earnings. This difference resulted from changes to U.S. GAAP, in part to converge with IFRS, in 2007. <sup>239</sup>

As a result of these changes, issuers are required to disclose more pro forma information about business combinations in interim periods than in annual periods, <sup>240</sup> even though Regulation S-X generally imposes fewer obligations with regard to interim financial statements. <sup>241</sup> Moreover, Rule 8-03(b)(4) requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP to present more line items than the corresponding requirement in Rule 10-01(b)(4) for non-SRCs, even though Commission disclosure requirements, as a general matter, provide certain accommodations for SRCs <sup>242</sup> and Regulation A issuers.

In proposing these amendments, the Commission noted that Item 9.01 of Form 8-K mitigates at least in part the absence of a U.S. GAAP requirement to present pro forma earnings per share, as it requires SRCs and non-SRCs to file pro forma financial information for significant acquisitions, including earnings per share, through the issuer’s most recently filed balance sheet. <sup>243</sup> We note, however, this pro forma financial information would not cover thesame periods as the pro forma information required under Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4) for SRCs and non-SRCs, and Form 8-K does not apply to Regulation A issuers. <sup>244</sup>

Based on the foregoing, the Commission proposed to eliminate the requirements for pro forma financial information in interim filings for business combinations in Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4).

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Several commenters supported the proposal to eliminate pro forma business combination financial information in interim filings. <sup>245</sup> However, other commenters opposed eliminating these requirements, expressing concern over the level of disclosure about merger and acquisition activities. <sup>246</sup> One commenter stated that frequent financial reporting about mergers, such as pro forma results on an interim basis, results in the issuer more timely identifying and disclosing problems related to a merger. <sup>247</sup> Another commenter recommended the disclosure requirements be improved rather than deleted because they provide a window into merger and acquisition activities. <sup>248</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are deleting the requirement for pro forma financial information in interim filings for business combinations in Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4) as proposed. We continue to believe that U.S. GAAP, and Item 9.01 of Form 8-K for SRCs and non-SRCs, result inreasonably similar disclosures as the corresponding requirements we are deleting. We also believe the elimination of these requirements will not result in less frequent financial reporting about mergers and their impact on issuers because U.S. GAAP will continue to require disclosure of such activities in interim periods as well as year-end. <sup>249</sup>

<h>b. Interim Financial Statements – Dispositions by SRCs and Tier 2 Regulation A Issuers</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

For significant dispositions, Regulation S-X requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP to disclose in the notes to the financial statements pro forma information. The pro forma disclosure requirements for dispositions for these issuers are the same as described above for significant business combinations. <sup>250</sup>

There are two types of dispositions: (1) those that meet the definition of discontinued operations and (2) all others (hereafter referred to as “other dispositions”). U.S. GAAP requires that the effects of discontinued operations be isolated and separately presented on the income statement on a retrospective basis, <sup>251</sup> thereby obviating the need for pro forma information for discontinued operations in the notes to the financial statements.

For other dispositions, we believe the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP generally result in reasonably similar disclosures as the pro forma disclosures mandated by Rule 8-03(b)(4).

Specifically, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of pre-tax profit and pre-tax profit attributable to theparent for individually significant dispositions for all interim periods presented. <sup>252</sup> However,

U.S. GAAP does not contain an equivalent to the requirement in Rule 8-03(b)(4) to disclose pro forma revenues as if the other disposal occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.

The Proposing Release noted that Item 9.01(b) of Form 8-K may help mitigate any loss of information about pro forma revenues, as it requires SRCs to file within four business days after a significant disposition, pro forma financial information pursuant to Rule 8-05 of Regulation S-X, including revenue, income from continuing operations, and income per share, through the most recently filed balance sheet date. This pro forma financial information would not cover the same periods as the separate results required under Rule 8-03(b)(4) and is not applicable to Regulation A issuers. <sup>253</sup>

In addition, Rule 8-03(b)(4) requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP to disclose more information about dispositions in interim periods than in annual periods, <sup>254</sup> even though Regulation S-X, as noted above, generally imposes fewer obligations with regard to interim financial statements. Moreover, Rule 8-03(b)(4) requires SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP to disclose more extensive information about other dispositions than is required of non-SRCs, <sup>255</sup> eventhough Commission disclosure requirements, as a general matter, provide certain scaled disclosure accommodations for SRCs. <sup>256</sup>

Accordingly, the Commission proposed to delete the pro forma disclosure requirements in Rule 8-03(b)(4).

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters <sup>257</sup> indicated that the requirement in Item 9.01 of Form 8-K <sup>258</sup> to provide pro forma financial information pursuant to Rule 8-05 does not sufficiently substitute for the pro forma disclosure requirement for significant dispositions in Rule 8-03(b)(4) for SRCs because Item 9.01 of Form 8-K only refers to significant acquisitions and does not reference dispositions. Several of these commenters were nevertheless supportive of the proposed deletion because, in their observation, a number of issuers provide pro forma information for significant dispositions under Item 9.01 of Form 8-K despite there not being an explicit requirement. <sup>259</sup> Some commenters recommended that the Commission amend Article 8 to encompass significant dispositions. <sup>260</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

After further consideration, we are retaining the pro forma disposition disclosure requirement in Rule 8-03(b)(4). We believe the views expressed by commenters about Item9.01(b) of Form 8-K and its reference to the pro forma requirements for significant acquisitions in Article 8 of Regulation S-X <sup>261</sup> warrant additional analysis and consideration.

<h>c. Segments</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Item 101(b) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of segment financial information, restatement of prior periods when reportable segments change, and discussion of interim segment performance that may not be indicative of current or future operations. U.S. GAAP <sup>262</sup> and Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K <sup>263</sup> require similar disclosures. Moreover, Item 101(b) explicitly permits issuers to cross-reference between the notes to the financial statements and the description of business to avoid duplicative disclosures about segments. The Commission, therefore, proposed to delete Item 101(b).

Regulation A issuers are similarly required to cross-reference to their segment disclosures under U.S. GAAP or IFRS. <sup>264</sup> The Commission, therefore, also proposed to delete Item 7(b) of Form 1-A.

Because the disclosure required by Item 101(b) of Regulation S-K and Item 7(b) of Form 1-A (or the cross-reference to the notes to the financial statements) are located in the businessdescription section of the filing, while the corresponding U.S. GAAP disclosures are in the notes to the financial statements, the Commission noted in the Proposing Release that the proposed elimination gives rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Most commenters supported the proposed amendments. <sup>265</sup> One of these commenters <sup>266</sup> observed that another disclosure requirement, <sup>267</sup> which requires segment disclosures for each year an audited financial statement is provided, also overlaps with U.S. GAAP. <sup>268</sup> One commenter opposed the proposed amendments, stating that the segment disclosures in Item 101(b) of Regulation S-K, along with other disclosures required by Item 101, are necessary in assessing and understanding a company’s ability to create long-term value for shareholders. <sup>269</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are eliminating the requirements in Item 101(b) of Regulation S-K and Item 7(b) of Form 1-A as proposed. While this will remove the requirement to provide financial information about segments in the business description section, these disclosures will continue to be available in the notes to the financial statements. Accordingly, we do not believe eliminating the requirement will affect the assessment and understanding of a company’s ability to create long- term value for shareholders. Additionally, we are eliminating Rule 3-03(e) of Regulation S-X, as suggested by a commenter, because it is also redundant with U.S. GAAP. <sup>270</sup> Further, U.S. GAAP requirements are broader than Rule 3-03(e) because U.S. GAAP requires segmentdisclosures for all periods for which a statement of income is provided, including unaudited interim periods, while Rule 3-03(e) requires the disclosure for each year for which an audited statement of income is provided.

<h>d. Geographic Areas</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Regulation S-K <sup>271</sup> requires disclosure of financial information by geographic area. U.S. GAAP requires similar disclosures. <sup>272</sup> Item 101(d)(2) explicitly permits issuers to cross- reference between the notes to the financial statements and the description of business to avoid duplicative disclosures about geographic areas. The Commission, therefore, proposed to delete Item 101(d)(1) and Item 101(d)(2).

Further, Item 101(d)(3) of Regulation S-K requires disclosures of any risks associated with an issuer’s foreign operations and any segment’s dependence on foreign operations. The Proposing Release stated that Item 101(d)(3) requires disclosures that appear to be largely encompassed by the disclosures that result from compliance with other parts of Regulation S-K. For example, Item 503(c) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of significant risk factors.

In addition, Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of trends and uncertainties by segment, if appropriate to an understanding of the issuer as a whole, which would include disclosure of a segment’s dependence on foreign operations. The Commission, therefore, proposed to delete Item 101(d)(3).

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Most commenters <sup>273</sup> were supportive of the proposed amendment, while a few commenters <sup>274</sup> opposed it. One commenter stated that the geographic area disclosures, along with other disclosures required by Item 101, are necessary in assessing and understanding a company’s ability to create long-term value for shareholders. <sup>275</sup> Another commenter expressed concern that the Commission is proposing to reduce information about the geographic segments of a business when geographic factors are growing in importance (i.e., foreign tax consideration). <sup>276</sup> This commenter further suggested that the Commission should simultaneously add explicit references to geographic factors in the required discussions of business risk and trends, if Items 101(d)(l)-(3) are eliminated.

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are eliminating the requirements in Item 101(d) as proposed. We believe that U.S. GAAP requires reasonably similar disclosures and note that Item 101(d)(2) explicitly permits issuers to cross-reference between the notes to the financial statements and the description of business to avoid duplicative disclosures about geographic areas. Further, we are amending, as proposed, Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K to add an explicit reference to “geographic areas.” <sup>277</sup> We believe this requirement, along with the disclosures required under Item 503(c) of Regulation S-K, will provide the disclosure necessary to understand the risks associated with geographic factors and to assess a company’s ability to create long-term value for shareholders.

<h>e. Seasonality</h>

<h>1. Proposed Amendments</h>

Regulation S-K <sup>278</sup> and U.S. GAAP <sup>279</sup> both require disclosures about seasonality in interim periods. Item 101(c)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K requires annual seasonality disclosure. Seasonality, by definition, relates to variations within annual periods, so the effects of seasonality are not evident in annual financial statements. The Proposing Release stated that interim seasonality disclosures required under U.S. GAAP seem more useful to investors than annual seasonality disclosures.

Item 101(c)(1)(v), unlike U.S. GAAP, incrementally requires seasonality disclosure at the segment level, to the extent material to an understanding of the business as a whole. Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources in interim periods at the segment level, when appropriate to an understanding of the business. <sup>280</sup> Accordingly, the Proposing Release stated that Item 303(b), in conjunction with

U.S. GAAP, would seem to result in reasonably similar disclosures as Item 101(c)(1)(v) about the effects of seasonality on an issuer’s financial statements at the segment level, if material and appropriate to an understanding of the business. The Commission therefore proposed to delete Item 101(c)(1)(iv). Because the disclosures required by Item 101(c)(1)(v) are located in the business description section, while the corresponding disclosures required by Item 303(b) and

U.S. GAAP are in MD&A and the notes to the financial statements, the proposed amendment gives rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations.

The Commission also proposed to delete Instruction 5 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K because it requires disclosures that convey reasonably similar information to the disclosures that result from compliance with U.S. GAAP. <sup>281</sup> The proposed deletion of Instruction 5 to Item 303(b) gives rise to Disclosure Location – Prominence Considerations because U.S. GAAP requires seasonality disclosures in the financial statements, whereas Instruction 5 requires disclosure in MD&A.

<h>2. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Most commenters supported the proposed amendments. <sup>282</sup> Some of these commenters also provided their views on the Disclosure Location Considerations. <sup>283</sup> For example, one commenter, who supported both proposed amendments, indicated that U.S. GAAP requires disclosure about seasonality when the interim financial statements reflect material seasonal variations, but it does not require disclosure when an issuer expects interim financial results to become seasonal or an issuer expects the seasonal financial results to change significantly in the future. <sup>284</sup> Another commenter recommended that the Commission consider feedback from preparers and users about the potential for registrants to reduce any voluntary information about seasonality that may currently be provided that is subject to the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. <sup>285</sup>

One commenter opposed the proposed amendments indicating that these disclosures, along with other disclosures required by Item 101, are necessary in assessing and understanding a company’s ability to create long-term value for shareholders. <sup>286</sup>

<h>3. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting as proposed the elimination of Instruction 5 to Item 303(b). We continue to believe that U.S. GAAP in combination with the remainder of Item 303 requires disclosures in interim reports that convey reasonably similar information to the disclosures required by Instruction 5 to Item 303(b). We also believe that, even without this instruction, the requirements in Item 303 elicit disclosure of forward-looking information in interim reports to the extent that the effects of seasonality may become material. <sup>287</sup> However, we are retaining the seasonality disclosure requirements in annual reports in Item 101(c)(1)(v), due to a concern about potential loss of information in the fourth quarter about the extent to which the business of an issuer or its segment(s) is or may be seasonal because U.S. GAAP may not elicit this disclosure. <sup>288</sup>

<h>f. Other</h>

The table below describes each of the remaining disclosure requirements that are overlapping with both U.S. GAAP and other Commission disclosure requirements. The related proposed amendments to delete those overlapping Commission disclosure requirements are also discussed below. <sup>289</sup>

Commenters generally supported the proposed amendments, <sup>294</sup> and no commenter specifically opposed the amendments. Accordingly, we are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed.

<h>C. Overlapping Requirements – Proposed Integrations</h>

In the proposing release, the Commission discussed disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, other Commission disclosure requirements. In these cases, the Commission proposed to integrate the overlapping Commission disclosure requirements.

<h>1. Foreign Currency Restrictions</h>

<h>a. Proposed Amendments</h>

If consolidation of foreign subsidiaries is deemed appropriate notwithstanding the presence of foreign currency exchange restrictions, Rule 3A-02(d) of Regulation S-X requires disclosure of the effect of foreign subsidiaries’ currency exchange restrictions upon theconsolidated financial position and operating results of the issuer and its subsidiaries. To streamline Commission disclosure requirements, the Commission proposed to relocate this requirement to Rule 3-20(b) of Regulation S-X, which addresses other currency considerations.

Rule 3-20(b), however, applies only to foreign private issuers, whereas Rule 3A-02(d) applies to all issuers. To prevent any loss of disclosure from the relocation of Rule 3A-02(d) to Rule 3-20(b), the Commission proposed to delete the reference to foreign private issuers in the title of Rule 3-20, <sup>295</sup> which would broaden the scope of Rule 3-20(b) and Rule 3-20(e) to all issuers. <sup>296</sup> Rule 3-20(b) also sets forth requirements for foreign private issuers if their reporting currency is not the U.S. dollar. Despite the proposed expansion of the scope of Rule 3-20(b) discussed above, the Commission stated in the Proposing Release that it did not intend to expand the instances in which a reporting currency other than the U.S. dollar would be permitted. The Commission therefore proposed amendments to Rule 3-20(a) to specify that domestic issuers and foreign issuers who do not meet the foreign private issuer definition <sup>297</sup> must present their financial statements in U.S. dollars.

<h>b. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters were generally supportive of the proposed amendments except for the proposed amendment to Rule 3-20(a). <sup>298</sup> Some commenters recommended that the Commission consider providing all registrants the same flexibility in selecting their reporting currency as foreign private issuers or allowing domestic issuers to report using the currency of the country inwhich they have substantially all of their operations. <sup>299</sup> Additionally, one of these commenters recommended further revisions to reorganize Rule 3-20 of Regulation S-X and to move the disclosure requirements for currency exchange restrictions from the financial statement footnotes to Item 303 of Regulation S-K. <sup>300</sup>

<h>c. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting the amendments to delete the reference to foreign private issuers in the title of Rule 3-20 and relocate the requirements of Rule 3A-02(d) to Rule 3-20(b) as proposed. We are also adopting the amendment to require a non-foreign private issuer to present its financial statements in U.S. dollars. This amendment is not intended to change current disclosure practices. Domestic issuers and foreign issuers that do not meet the foreign private issuer definition may continue to request to present financial statements in a currency other than

U.S. dollars in appropriate circumstances. <sup>301</sup>

In addition, while we acknowledge commenters’ recommendation that we consider providing all registrants the flexibility to select their reporting currency; we are not adopting that suggestion at this time. We believe more information is needed to determine whether any unintended consequences could result, and thus believe such a change is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

In a technical change for clarification, we also are replacing the word “selected”, in the phrase “currency selected for reporting purposes,” with “used” in Rule 3-20(d) because non- foreign private issuers are not permitted to “select” their reporting currency.

<h>2. Restrictions on Dividends and Related Items</h>

Commission requirements mandate disclosure about restrictions on the payment of dividends and related items in a number of locations. The table below describes each of the disclosure requirements related to this mandate, the proposed amendment, and reason for it. <sup>302</sup>

Commenters generally supported the proposed amendments, <sup>310</sup> and no commenter specifically opposed the amendments. Accordingly, we are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed. The amendments simplify our disclosure requirements by integrating overlapping Commission disclosure requirements into existing disclosure requirements where the incremental information is reasonably similar.

<h>3. Geographic Areas</h>

Item 101(d)(4) of Regulation S-K requires, when interim financial statements are presented, a discussion of the facts that indicate the three-year financial data for geographic performance may not be indicative of current or future operations. This requirement is similar to requirements in Instruction 3 to Item 303(a) and Instruction 4 to Item 303(b) to identify elements of income which are not necessarily indicative of the issuer’s ongoing business, except that there is no explicit reference to “geographic areas” in either requirement. To streamline the requirements in Regulation S-K, the Commission proposed to revise Item 303 to add an explicit reference to “geographic areas” and delete Item 101(d)(4).

Commenters were generally supportive of the proposed amendments. <sup>311</sup> Some commenters recommended clarification of the proposed revision to Item 303, noting that it is not clear whether an issuer must discuss the geographic information as part of the segment discussion or has a choice to discuss its operations on a segment or geographical basis. <sup>312</sup>

We are adopting the amendment substantially as proposed. As suggested by commenters, we are clarifying that geographic areas are an example of a subdivision of a business that is required to be discussed when management believes such discussion would be appropriate to anunderstanding of the business and that discussion of geographic areas is not required in all circumstances.

<h>D. Overlapping Requirements – FASB Referrals</h>

In the proposing release, the Commission discussed Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP and solicited comments to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. For the reasons discussed below, we have determined to refer the incremental Commission disclosure requirements described in this section to the FASB for its consideration of whether to incorporate such disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP as part of its normal standard-setting process. The discussion in this section, as well as Sections I.C., II.B., and III.B., constitute our referral to the FASB.

Any incorporation of these incremental Commission disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP could potentially affect all entities that prepare financial statements under U.S. GAAP, including those outside the scope of our regulatory authority. Additionally, the disclosure requirements described below in Section III.D.3 and certain Topics in Section III.D.5 <sup>313</sup> currently allow for scaled disclosure by SRCs and issuers relying on Regulation A or Regulation Crowdfunding. Depending on how these disclosures are incorporated, if at all, into U.S. GAAP,

U.S. GAAP may not permit these issuers to scale such disclosures.

By April 4, 2020, we request that the FASB complete its process to determine whether the referred disclosure items will be added to its agenda of projects for potential standard-setting. In the meantime, we are retaining the disclosure requirements discussed in this section. Anyfuture consideration of amendments to these disclosure requirements will take into account the outcome of the standard-setting activities undertaken by the FASB, if any, in response to the referrals we are making.

<h>1. Discount on Shares</h>

Regulation S-X <sup>314</sup> and U.S. GAAP <sup>315</sup> both set forth requirements about the presentation of items in the equity section of the financial statements. However, Regulation S-X incrementally requires discounts on shares to be presented separately as a deduction from the applicable accounts. Discounts on shares may arise, for example, from stock issuance costs, which are recognized as a reduction in equity. <sup>316</sup> In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comments to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer this disclosure requirement to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

Some commenters recommended that the Commission eliminate the disclosure requirement in Regulation S-X, for the following reasons: (1) stock issuance costs recorded within equity do not amortize, and therefore, the commenters did not see the ongoing relevance of the disclosure; (2) in the period of issuance, such costs are already required to be presented separately in the financing section of the statement of cash flows; and (3) other discounts to par or stated value are likely captured by other disclosure requirements. <sup>317</sup> Other commenters recommended that the Commission refer the incremental disclosure requirement to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. <sup>318</sup>

There are various types of transactions that could result in discount on shares.

Commenters supporting elimination of the Regulation S-X requirement indicated that U.S. GAAP overlaps with Rule 4-07 with respect to stock issuance costs but did not state whether

U.S. GAAP overlaps with respect to other transactions that result in discount on shares. Based on these considerations, we are retaining the disclosure requirements in Rule 4-07 and are referring them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

<h>2. Income Tax Disclosures</h>

Regulation S-X <sup>320</sup> and U.S. GAAP <sup>321</sup> both require disclosures about income taxes in the notes to the financial statements. <sup>322</sup> However, Rule 4-08(h) includes certain incremental requirements, some of which give rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.

Specifically, although U.S. GAAP and Regulation S-X both require disclosure of the components of income tax expense, Rule 4-08(h) incrementally: (1) requires disclosure of the amount of domestic and foreign pre-tax income and income tax expense, (2) requires disaggregation of the foreign component of pre-tax income and income tax expense with the domestic component if it exceeds five percent of the respective total, and (3) defines “foreign” for purposes of this disclosure.

In addition, although U.S. GAAP and Regulation S-X both require a reconciliation of the domestic federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate, Rule 4-08(h) incrementally: (1) requires disaggregation of reconciling items if they individually exceed five percent of thehttp://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/FASBContent_C/ProjectUpdatePage&cid=1176164227426.amount computed by multiplying pre-tax income by the applicable statutory income tax rate, (2) clarifies the statutory tax rate to use in the income tax rate reconciliation for foreign issuers, and(3) requires, when the statutory tax rate used differs from the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, disclosure of the basis for using that rate.

In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comments to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer these disclosure requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

Several commenters recommended elimination of the Commission disclosure requirements, if the FASB adopts its proposed income tax standard. <sup>323</sup> Some of these commenters further indicated that, if the proposed income tax standard is not adopted, the Commission should consider comments received by the FASB to determine whether further amendment should be made to Rule 4-08(h). <sup>324</sup> Some commenters recommended retaining both requirements under Rule 4-08(h) and U.S. GAAP, as they believe investors need more detailed disclosure of corporate income tax liabilities. <sup>325</sup> Only one commenter recommended that the Commission refer this issue to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S.GAAP. <sup>326</sup>

Additionally, a number of commenters recommended that the Commission require disclosure of certain information, such as profit or loss before taxes and effective tax rate, on acountry-by-country basis. <sup>327</sup> Some of these commenters indicated that this transparency would help investors assess the risks that could arise from operating in multiple jurisdictions <sup>328</sup> as well as the likelihood of repatriation of foreign earnings. <sup>329</sup> Some of the commenters who recommended the country-by-country disclosure also recommended requiring the disclosure of the aggregate amount corporations would owe in U.S. taxes should they repatriate their offshore earnings. <sup>330</sup> In contrast, one commenter indicated that further disaggregating foreign amounts by foreign jurisdiction would not provide useful information as such disaggregation would neither reflect exposure to future foreign tax nor shed light on future potential repatriation. <sup>331</sup> This commenter further recommended that the current five percent thresholds for the effective rate reconciliation be revisited, as they can result in an unnecessarily large number of line items when pre-tax income is relatively small.

After considering the comments, we are retaining the income tax disclosure requirements in Rule 4-08(h). While we acknowledge the suggestions made by commenters related to additional income tax disclosures, these are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. There also have been significant changes to the tax law that may affect the accounting and disclosure requirements for income taxes. <sup>332</sup> We are referring these disclosure requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. The FASB is currently reviewing its disclosurerequirements for income taxes and discussing the financial reporting effects of recent changes in tax law. <sup>333</sup>

<h>3. Major Customers</h>

Regulation S-K <sup>334</sup> and U.S. GAAP <sup>335</sup> both require disclosures about major customers.

However, Regulation S-K is more expansive in its requirements and differs from U.S. GAAP in two ways: (1) the threshold for disclosure and (2) the requirement to disclose a customer’s name in certain instances. We note that because disclosures required by Regulation S-K, unlike those required by U.S. GAAP, may be provided outside of the audited financial statements, these differences give rise to Disclosure Location – Financial Disclosure Considerations. These differences also give rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations.

First, Item 101(c)(1)(vii) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure if loss of a customer, or a few customers, would have a material adverse effect on a segment. This threshold differs from

U.S. GAAP in that it is qualitative and focuses on the impact on a segment. In contrast, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of each customer that comprises 10 percent or more of total revenue. Although the requirements for SRCs in Item 101(h)(4)(vi) are more similar to U.S. GAAP in that they do not prescribe a segment focus, they also differ from U.S. GAAP in that they do not set forth a 10 percent bright line test for disclosure.

Second, Item 101(c)(1)(vii) requires disclosure of the name of any customer that represents 10 percent or more of the issuer’s revenues and whose loss would have a materialadverse effect on the issuer. <sup>336</sup> In 1999, the Commission considered deleting this requirement to conform to U.S. GAAP. However, the Commission determined to retain this requirement, as it continued to believe that the identity of major customers is material information to investors and that the disclosure allows a reader to better assess risks associated with a particular customer, as well as material concentrations of revenues related to that customer. <sup>337</sup>

Because U.S. GAAP historically has scaled disclosure requirements only by public business entities versus other entities, and not by issuer status, incorporation of these requirements into U.S. GAAP could result in the application to SRCs of the disclosure threshold and the requirement to name a customer in certain instances.

Several commenters supported the Commission eliminating this disclosure requirement because it is substantially similar to the corresponding U.S. GAAP requirements, which they believe sufficiently highlight customer concentrations. <sup>338</sup> A few commenters further suggested that the disclosure of major customers could be harmful because of the competitively sensitive nature of this information. <sup>339</sup> The remaining commenters supported referring the requirement to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. <sup>340</sup> One of these commenters also recommended the FASB consider whether the disclosure objective in U.S. GAAP should be clarified. <sup>341</sup> Another commenter recommended a principles-based approach rather than a bright line disclosure threshold for the requirement to disclose customer names, as this threshold maynot be material to some registrants. <sup>342</sup> One commenter recommended retaining the requirement, asserting that the identity of major customers is material information to investors and it allows a reader to better assess risks associated with a particular customer, as well as material concentrations of revenues related to that customer. <sup>343</sup>

We are retaining this disclosure requirement and are referring it to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. We believe the objective of the U.S. GAAP disclosure requirement is similar to the Commission disclosure requirement; however, U.S. GAAP does not require disclosure of a major customer’s name.

<h>4. Legal Proceedings</h>

U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of certain loss contingencies. <sup>344</sup> 17 CFR 229.103 (“Item 103” of Regulation S-K) requires disclosure of certain legal proceedings, which are one type of loss contingency. Item 103 does not require disclosure of certain matters that do not exceed 10 percent of the issuer’s consolidated current assets, while U.S. GAAP provides a more general materiality threshold. <sup>345</sup> In practice, to comply with Regulation S-K, issuers commonly repeat some or all of the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements under U.S. GAAP or include a cross-reference to those disclosures.

As further described in Section III.E.15 of the Proposing Release, although Item 103 and

U.S. GAAP have overlapping requirements, they differ in certain respects. Incorporation of Item 103 requirements into U.S. GAAP would have implications for investors, issuers, and other stakeholders. In the Proposing Release, the Commission described in detail (a) the differencesbetween Item 103 and U.S. GAAP; (b) the potential consequences of incorporating the Item 103 requirements into U.S. GAAP; and (c) other considerations related to Item 103. The Commission solicited comment about whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer the disclosure requirements to the FASB.

Many commenters opposed the integration of Item 103 and U.S. GAAP. <sup>346</sup> A number of commenters <sup>347</sup> stated that the objectives <sup>348</sup> of Item 103 and U.S. GAAP differ, and some of these commenters <sup>349</sup> indicated that a better articulation of the objectives may be warranted. Many commenters <sup>350</sup> also indicated that, if the Commission chooses to move forward with the integration, the American Bar Association policy statement regarding lawyers’ responses to auditors’ requests for information and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) auditing standards should be revisited as they both incorporate the U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements. <sup>351</sup> On a similar note, some commenters <sup>352</sup> indicated that integration would also expand audit and interim review requirements, as well as XBRL tagging requirements, which would be burdensome and costly to issuers. These commenters further expressed concern that the integration could lead to increased disclosure of immaterial items and may eliminate the safe-harbor protections currently afforded to forward-looking statements related to legal proceedings under Regulation S-K.

Some commenters recommended the deletion of Item 103 altogether or at minimum some of the disclosure requirements contained therein. <sup>353</sup> For example, one of these commenters stated that U.S. GAAP, together with Items 303 and 503(c) of Regulation S-K, elicits the appropriate level of disclosure of material legal proceedings to inform investment and voting decisions of a reasonable investor. <sup>354</sup> Another commenter recommended the deletion of the requirement to disclose proceedings known to be contemplated but which are not probable of being asserted because this does not provide useful information to investors. <sup>355</sup>

The commenters <sup>356</sup> who supported the integration of Item 103 into U.S. GAAP noted the repetition that is currently present in many filings. <sup>357</sup> However, one of these commenters recommended the Commission consider undertaking outreach with preparers, users, and other regulators and develop disclosure objectives for the incremental disclosures. <sup>358</sup> Other commenters also recommended that the Commission conduct more analysis and outreach in this area, particularly with the accounting and legal professions. <sup>359</sup>

Some commenters indicated that the existing disclosure requirements in both Item 103 and U.S. GAAP do not provide sufficient information for investors to understand the nature, potential magnitude, and timing of any loss contingencies relating to legal proceedings, andrecommended specific changes to the requirements. <sup>360</sup> Some of their recommendations include greater use of bright line disclosure thresholds and preserving Item 103’s disclosure requirements for low-probability but high magnitude liabilities. <sup>361</sup>

Additionally, several commenters <sup>362</sup> expressed concerns with the bright line disclosure threshold for certain matters imposed by the existing requirements in Item 103, stating that some of the disclosures based on the threshold may not be material.

In response to the concerns expressed by commenters, we are retaining the disclosure requirements in Item 103 without amendment. In addition, we are not referring these disclosure requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP at this time. In light of the various views expressed by commenters, we believe further consideration is warranted with respect to the implications of potential changes to these requirements.

<h>5. Other</h>

The table below describes the remaining overlapping requirements discussed in the proposing release as well as the incremental differences between these requirements. <sup>363</sup>certain repurchase liabilities, (3) information about counterparties and agreements with them, where there is a concentration of counterparties, (4) separate presentation on the balance sheet of the carrying amount of reverse repurchase agreements, and (5) disclosure of the nature of any provisions to ensure that the market value of the underlying assets remains sufficient to protect the issuer in the event of counterparty default.

Some commenters recommended that the Commission eliminate some of these disclosure requirements because the required disclosures are available elsewhere. <sup>380</sup> For example, one commenter recommended the deletion of the requirement related to tax status of distributions per unit <sup>381</sup> because this information is available to shareholders in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099. <sup>382</sup> Some commenters recommended eliminating the consolidation disclosure requirements in Rule 3A-03(b) because they overlap with U.S. GAAP <sup>383</sup> disclosure requirements. <sup>384</sup> One commenter recommended deletion of the repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement disclosure requirements because they provide reasonably similar information as the corresponding U.S. GAAP requirements. <sup>385</sup> This commenter recommended that the only repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement disclosure requirement that the Commission should refer to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP is the requirement to disclose the repurchase liability and the interest rate(s) thereon. <sup>386</sup> Another commenter recommended eliminating certain interim financial statement information due tooverlapping U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements. <sup>387</sup> Some commenters also suggested eliminating the products and services disclosure requirement <sup>388</sup> because U.S. GAAP <sup>389</sup> requires substantially similar disclosures. <sup>390</sup> These commenters observed that while U.S. GAAP provides an impracticability exception, that exception is used infrequently and, when it is relied upon, the issuer will have the same practicability issue with providing the products and services disclosures under Regulation S-K. A few commenters observed that U.S. GAAP oil and gas producing disclosures are generally interpreted to apply to each period presented. <sup>391</sup> For this reason, one commenter recommended deletion of Item 302(b) of Regulation S-K. <sup>392</sup>

Most commenters, however, including some who recommended eliminating certain disclosure requirements, supported the Commission retaining most or all of these disclosure requirements and referring them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. <sup>393</sup> One commenter specifically requested the Commission retain the disclosure requirements for repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements as they are complex financial instruments that can impact the financing and liquidity of financial institutions and other businesses. <sup>394</sup>

Commenters had the following additional recommendations for both the Commission and the FASB as it relates to the potential incorporation of the Commission’s disclosure requirements into U.S. GAAP:

Revisit the bright line disclosure thresholds in the requirements (e.g., the 10% threshold in Rule 4-08(m)) and whether U.S. GAAP should require similar bright line disclosure thresholds; <sup>395</sup>

Clarify the concept of “authorization of debt” in Rule 4-08(f); <sup>396</sup>

Coordinate to provide enhanced disclosures for significant accounting policies that provide a more comprehensive discussion of critical accounting estimates, including more robust information about underlying assumptions that are highly judgmental, as well as their propensity to change; <sup>397</sup>

Consider the timing of the disclosure requirements related to combinations of entities under common control because these disclosures could be useful to investors on both an interim and annual basis and ensure the disclosure objectives and requirements are clear; <sup>398</sup> and

Work together to further reduce redundancies between Commission disclosure requirements and U.S. GAAP, such as the oil and gas disclosures in 17 CFR 229.1200 (“Item 1200” of Regulation S-K) and those in U.S. GAAP <sup>399</sup> industry standards. <sup>400</sup>

We are retaining these requirements and referring all of the disclosure requirements described in the table above to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

<h>IV. Outdated Requirements</h>

<h>A. Background</h>

The Commission proposed to amend certain requirements that have become outdated as a result of the passage of time or changes in the regulatory, business, or technological environments. These amendments were intended to simplify issuer compliance efforts. Further, to reduce any loss of information or increased burdens for investors, the Commission also proposed to require additional disclosure of information that is expected to be readily available to issuers.

<h>B. Disclosure requirements outdated due to passage of time</h>

In the Proposing Release, the Commission noted that some of its disclosure requirements have become obsolete due to passage of time. The table below describes each outdated requirement and what the Commission proposed to eliminate. <sup>401</sup>

Commenters supported the proposed amendments to delete the requirements above, which have become outdated. <sup>402</sup> We are adopting both of the amendments described in the table above as proposed.

<h>C. Disclosure requirements outdated due to changes in the regulatory, business, or technological environment</h>

In the Proposing Release, the Commission staff noted that some of its disclosure requirements have become obsolete as the regulatory, business, or technological environments have changed over time. For example, some of the Commission’s disclosure requirements are no longer relevant, or some information required to be disclosed is no longer readily available or can be derived from alternative sources. Below we discuss these outdated requirements and the related proposed amendments.

<h>1. Market Price Disclosure</h>

<h>a. Proposed Amendments</h>

Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K requires issuers to disclose the following:

The principal U.S. market(s) where its common equity is traded. Foreign issuers must also disclose the principal established foreign public trading market, if applicable. Whereapplicable, issuers must disclose that there is no established public trading market for their common equity. <sup>403</sup>

If the principal U.S. market is an exchange, the high and low sale prices for their common equity for each quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and subsequent interim period. <sup>404</sup>

If the principal U.S. market is not an exchange, the high and low bid quotations for the same periods as above. Where applicable, issuers must identify the source of the quotations and include appropriate qualifying language. <sup>405</sup>

Foreign issuers that identify a principal established foreign trading market for common equity are also required to provide market price disclosure comparable to that of a domestic issuer. If the primary U.S. market for the foreign issuer trades using American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), then foreign issuers must disclose prices based on the ADRs. <sup>406</sup>

When Item 201(a)(1) disclosure is included in a Securities Act registration statement or an Exchange Act proxy or information statement, the price for their common equity as of the latest practicable date. <sup>407</sup>

Today, the daily market prices of most publicly traded common equity securities, including those quoted on an automated quotation system, are readily available free on numerous websites, including the exchanges’ or quotation systems’ websites. <sup>408</sup> On these websites, investors can view daily closing prices, up to the previous day, and intra-day quotes, which would be more up-to-date than the prices required by Item 201(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. Additionally, many of these websites allow users to download the daily historical data over customized time horizons. These features result in more robust information than the disclosure required by Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K.

As a result, the Commission proposed the following amendments to Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K:

Issuers with one or more classes of common equity would be required to disclose the principal U.S. market(s) where each class is traded and the trading symbol(s) used by the market(s) for each class of common equity. Foreign issuers also would be required to identify the principal established foreign public trading market, if any, and the trading symbol(s), for each class of their common equity.

Issuers with common equity that is not traded on an exchange would be required to indicate, as applicable, that any over-the-counter quotations in such trading systems reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.

Issuers with no class of common equity traded in an established public trading market would be required to state that fact and disclose the range of high and low bidinformation, if applicable, for each quarter over the last two fiscal years and any subsequent interim period. <sup>409</sup> Also, such issuers would be required to disclose the source and explain the nature of such quotations.

As proposed to be amended, Item 201(a)(1) would eliminate the detailed disclosure requirement of sale or bid prices for most issuers whose common equity is traded in an established public trading market and replace it with disclosure of the trading symbol. <sup>410</sup> The proposed amendments would also align Item 201(a)(1) with Item 501(b)(4) of Regulation S- K. <sup>411</sup>

Foreign private issuers that file Form 20-F are subject to disclosure requirements similar to those included in Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K. Item 9.A.4 of Form 20-F requires the following price history of the stock to be offered or listed for both the U.S. market and the principal trading market outside the United States, as applicable:

The annual high and low market prices for the last five full financial years;

Quarterly high and low market prices for the last two full financial years and any subsequent period; and

Monthly high and low market prices for the last six months.

For preemptive share issuances, the issuer must disclose the market prices for the first trading day in the most recent six months, the last trading day before the announcement of the offering, and for the latest practicable date. If an issuer’s securities are “not regularly traded in an organized market,” the issuer must discuss any lack of liquidity.

The Commission also proposed to amend Item 9.A.4 of Form 20-F to be consistent with the proposals related to Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K. Specifically, the Commission proposed to amend Item 9.A.4 to require disclosure of the U.S. and principal market(s) where the issuer’s common equity trades and the trading symbol(s) assigned to the issuer’s common equity that is traded in the U.S. market and principal market. For issuers whose common equity is not traded in any established public trading market, disclosure of that fact would still be required.

<h>b. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters generally supported the proposed amendments. <sup>412</sup> In the Proposing Release the Commission asked if investors and issuers understood the term “established public trading market” and whether further guidance is needed to determine what constitutes “limited or sporadic quotations.” <sup>413</sup> One commenter recommended that the Commission clarify and define these terms without suggesting specific changes. <sup>414</sup> Another commenter recommended that the Commission require disclosure of trading symbol(s) for primary markets where all issued “instruments” are traded, and define clear standards for the ticker notation so that all filers usethe same notation. <sup>415</sup> This commenter also recommended disclosure of the security identifier (CUSIP) in addition to the trading symbol and the ADR ratio, <sup>416</sup> as applicable.

<h>c. Final Amendments</h>

To help investors locate listed securities and current trading prices, we are adopting the amendment to Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K and Item 9.A.4 of Form 20-F substantially as proposed, with minor modifications. First, we are removing the term “established” from “principal established foreign public trading market” in Item 201(a)(1) to be consistent with the scope of disclosure required for domestic issuers in the U.S. market and for foreign private issuers in Item 9.A.4. Second, we are retaining the clarification currently in Item 9.A.4 that “principal market” means “outside the host market” as this language was inadvertently proposed for elimination. Finally, we are adding the term “principal” in front of “host market” in the amended first sentence of Item 9.A.4. to be consistent with Item 201, which requires disclosure of “principal United States market(s).” <sup>417</sup>

In addition, while we acknowledge the commenter’s recommendations that we also require disclosure of trading symbol(s) for all issued “instruments,” as well as CUSIP and ADR ratio when applicable, we are not adopting that suggestion as it is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

<h>2. Other</h>

The table below describes each of the remaining disclosure requirements that have become obsolete as the regulatory, business, or technological environments changed over time, and the related proposed amendments. <sup>418</sup>

Commenters supported the proposed amendments and agreed with the reasons provided in the Proposing Release. <sup>423</sup> We are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed, which will remove obsolete disclosure requirements and reduce issuers’ compliance burdens.

<h>V. Superseded Requirements</h>

<h>A. Background</h>

As accounting, auditing, and disclosure requirements have changed over time, inconsistencies have arisen between the newer requirements and existing Commission disclosure requirements. The Commission proposed amendments to update Commission disclosurerequirements to reflect more recently updated U.S. GAAP requirements or more recently updated Commission disclosure requirements.

<h>B. Disclosure Requirements Superseded by U.S. GAAP</h>

The Commission staff has observed in its filing reviews that, in practice, issuers are able to successfully navigate inconsistencies between newer accounting and disclosure requirements and existing Commission disclosure requirements by complying with the requirement that was updated more recently. This is particularly the case with respect to changes in U.S. GAAP requirements, as the Commission has designated the FASB as the private-sector accounting standard setter. <sup>424</sup> However, the Commission sought to simplify compliance efforts by proposing changes to several disclosure requirements that the Commission believed were superseded by U.S. GAAP. <sup>425</sup>

<h>1. Gains or Loss on Sale of Properties by REITS</h>

Regulation S-X requires REITs to present separately all gains and losses on the sale of properties outside of continuing operations in the income statement. <sup>426</sup> U.S. GAAP, however, restricts that presentation to gains and losses on disposals that meet the definition of discontinued operations. <sup>427</sup> As a result, the Commission proposed to eliminate Rule 3-15(a)(1) of Regulation S-X.

Commenters were supportive of the proposed amendment. <sup>428</sup> We are adopting the elimination of Rule 3-15(a)(1) of Regulation S-X as proposed. We believe this amendment will simplify compliance for issuers by eliminating the disclosure requirement in Rule 3-15(a)(1) of Regulation S-X that conflicts with the requirement in U.S. GAAP.

<h>2. Consolidation</h>

<h>a. Proposed Amendments</h>

The Commission provided guidance on the presentation of consolidated and combined financial statements when it first issued Regulation S-X in 1940. <sup>429</sup> Since that time, certain U.S. GAAP consolidation requirements have changed significantly, creating inconsistencies between Regulation S-X and U.S. GAAP. <sup>430</sup> For instance, Article 3A of Regulation S-X, Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements , includes several inconsistencies with U.S. GAAP related to difference in fiscal periods, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”), and intercompany transactions. The table below describes each requirement related to consolidation that the Commission proposed to eliminate and the reason for its proposed elimination. <sup>431</sup>

U.S. GAAP, which prohibits this per share presentation on the face of financial statements. However, the Commission saw benefits in continuing to provide (and extending to interim periods) an option to present dividends per share on the face of the statement of stockholders’ equity, if an issuer elects to present changes in stockholders’ equity in a separate financial statement, irrespective of the prohibition under U.S. GAAP. The Commission believed that the presentation of dividends per share alongside disclosure of changes in stockholders’ equity facilitates investor understanding of stockholders’ equity, as dividends are distributed from stockholders’ equity. In addition, the proposed amendments address the more significant issue in Regulation S-X associated with the requirement to present interim dividends per share on the income statement, which is unrelated to dividends, a component of stockholders’ equity.

For Regulation A issuers, the Commission proposed amendments directly to Forms 1-A and 1-SA to require interim disclosures of changes in stockholders’ equity and dividends per share amounts to address the inconsistency described above with U.S. GAAP, rather than to refer to Rule 3-04. The proposed amendments to Form 1-A would apply to all Regulation A issuers and the proposed amendments to Form1-SA would apply to all Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering, even though Rule 8-03(a)(2) only applies to Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP. However, the Commission did not expect any increased burdens for Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under IFRS, as such issuers are already required to present a condensed statement of changes in equity and dividend amounts either in the aggregate or per share, pursuant to paragraphs 8 and 16A(f), respectively, of IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting . The Commission expected the burdens for Regulation A issuers in a Tier 1 offering that report under U.S. GAAP on Form 1-A to be minimal, as the required information already would be available from the preparation of the interim financial statements.

<h>b. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters were generally supportive of the proposed amendments. <sup>446</sup> Some commenters asked for clarification on whether the amendment to extend the changes in stockholders’ equity and non-controlling interests disclosure requirement to interim periods would be presented only for the year-to-date period, or for quarterly period(s) as well. <sup>447</sup> One commenter supported the proposed elimination of Rule 8-03(a)(2) and Rule 10-01(b)(2) in Regulation S-X, but questioned whether the extension of the disclosure requirement in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim periods was necessary or efficient. <sup>448</sup> As an alternative, the commenter recommended amending Regulation S-X to move the dividend per share disclosure requirements from the face of the financial statements to the notes to the financial statements, which would eliminate the conflict with U.S. GAAP.

One commenter observed the need to update Rule 6-03(c)(1)(i) of Regulation S-X, which also has been superseded by U.S. GAAP. <sup>449</sup> The commenter noted the Commission disclosure requirement permits the consolidation of the financial statements of registered investment companies and business development companies only with the financial statements of subsidiaries which are investment companies, whereas U.S. GAAP also permits consolidation when an investment company holds a controlling financial interest in an operating entity that provides services to the investment company. <sup>450</sup>

<h>c. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting the amendments as proposed with one minor change. As suggested by commenters, the final amendments clarify that Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X requires both the year-to-date information and subtotals for each interim period.

The extension of the disclosure requirement in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X may create some additional burden for issuers, including Regulation A issuers, because it will require disclosure of dividends per share for each class of shares, rather than only for common stock, and disclosure of changes in stockholders’ equity in interim periods. <sup>451</sup> However, as noted in the Proposing Release, we expect this burden will be minimal, as the required information is already available from the preparation of other aspects of the interim financial information such as the balance sheet and earnings per share. <sup>452</sup> The amended rule will require companies to provide information on the dividends issued and the relationship the dividends have to stockholders’ equity in one place, which may help investors understand some of the strategic decisions made by management, such as dividend payout versus share buyback.

In response to a commenter’s suggestion, we are deleting the requirements for consolidation by investment companies in Regulation S-X <sup>453</sup> because it conflicts with U.S. GAAP. The U.S. GAAP requirement is broader and additionally requires consolidated financial statements when a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in another entity.

<h>3. Development Stage Companies</h>

U.S. GAAP previously required presentation of cumulative financial information from inception and related disclosures for development stage companies. <sup>454</sup> Regulation S-X requires the U.S. GAAP disclosures for development stage companies in interim periods. <sup>455</sup> In June 2014, the FASB eliminated the U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements for development stage companies. <sup>456</sup> Accordingly, the Commission proposed to eliminate the superseded U.S. GAAP disclosure requirement for development stage companies in Rule 8-03(b)(6) and Rule 10- 01(a)(7).

Commenters supported our proposal to eliminate these requirements. <sup>457</sup> Some of these commenters also recommended deleting the definition of development stage company in in Rule 1-02(h) of Regulation S-X. <sup>458</sup>

We are adopting the amendments as proposed. We are not deleting the definition of development stage company in Rule 1-02(h) of Regulation S-X as it is used in other Commission requirements (e.g., Rule 251(b)(3) of Regulation A and Rule 419(a)(2)(i) of Regulation C). As a result, we believe the definition in Rule 1-02(h) of Regulation S-X continues to be useful when applying these other Commission requirements.

<h>4. Insurance Companies</h>

<h>a. Proposed Amendments17 CFR 210.7-02(b) (“Rule 7-02(b)” of Regulation S-X) permits mutual life insurance companies and their wholly-owned stock insurance company subsidiaries to prepare financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting requirements. In the proposing release, the Commission proposed to eliminate this rule, as the Commission did not believe that issuers under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act currently rely on Rule 7-02(b) of Regulation S-X as a basis to report under statutory accounting requirements. <sup>459</sup></h>

The Commission also proposed two other amendments related to Insurance Companies and Regulation S-X. The first amendment relates to the separate presentation on the balance sheet of an asset called “reinsurance recoverable on paid losses.” <sup>460</sup> The Commission proposed to delete the reference to “paid losses” in this line item because U.S. GAAP was revised in 1992 to allow reinsurance recoverable receivables on paid and unpaid losses to be presented together. <sup>461</sup> The second amendment relates to the definition of “Separate Account Assets” that are presented separately as a summary total on the balance sheet. <sup>462</sup> U.S. GAAP definesdifferently separate account assets that are required to be reported as a summary total. <sup>463</sup> Thus, the Commission proposed to replace the reference to variable annuities, pension funds, and similar activities in Rule 7-03(a)(11) with a reference to U.S. GAAP.

<h>b. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Many commenters supported all three proposals. <sup>464</sup> However, some commenters opposed the elimination of the ability of mutual life insurance companies to utilize statutory accounting principles for registration of insurance products under the Securities Act. <sup>465</sup> These commenters stated that the preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements would impose significant financial and administrative burdens on mutual life insurers. These commenters indicated that if the amendments to Rule 7-02(b) were adopted, a mutual insurance company issuing a general account insurance product would have to comply with the requirement to provide U.S. GAAP financial statements in Form S-1 or S-3, and as a result, mutual life insurance companies that do not already prepare U.S. GAAP financial statements may limit their offerings of general account insurance products. One commenter suggested that the Commission should expand Rule 7-02(b) to allow its application to all insurance companies that do not otherwise prepare U.S. GAAP financial statements. <sup>466</sup> Other commenters advised that elimination of the rule should involve a full analysis of the potential costs and benefits. <sup>467</sup> These commenters also outlined the relevance of financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles for general account insurance products.

<h>c. Final Amendments</h>

After further consideration and in light of the concerns expressed by commenters, we are not adopting the proposed amendment to eliminate Rule 7-02(b). We are adopting the amendments to Rule 7-03(a)(6) and 7-03(a)(11) as proposed to simplify compliance for issuers by removing the elements of those rules that conflict with U.S. GAAP.

<h>5. Extraordinary Items</h>

<h>a. Proposed Amendments</h>

Various Commission disclosure requirements and forms refer to extraordinary items. In January 2015, the FASB eliminated extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. <sup>468</sup> To update Commission disclosure requirements, the Commission proposed to delete references to extraordinary items in our rules and forms. <sup>469</sup> The Commission proposed to delete the requirement in Item 302(a)(1) of Regulation S-K to disclose “income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting” in supplemental quarterly financial information, and in its place, require disclosure of “Income (loss).” The Commission also

Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act contains a net income measure that is used in evaluating whether certain equity securities are penny stocks, which currently excludes “extraordinary and non-recurring items” from the net income calculation. As a result of the proposed amendment, the reference to “extraordinary items” would be deleted, but the exclusion of non-recurring items from net income would remain. The deletion of the “extraordinary items” reference from net income calculations under Rule 3a51-1 is not intended to affect the application of the rule , as we believe that non-recurring items encompass items that would have been “extraordinary items” previously. Thus, the calculation of net income for purposes of Rule 3a51-1 should not change.proposed amendments to the investment company registration forms (Form N-1A, Form N-3, Form N-4, and Form N-6) to replace the outdated reference to the U.S. GAAP definition of extraordinary items with a definition of extraordinary expenses <sup>470</sup> The Proposing Release indicated that the proposed amendments were not intended to change the content required to be presented in these forms. <sup>471</sup>

<h>b. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

While commenters <sup>472</sup> generally supported the proposed amendments, some commenters <sup>473</sup> recommended requiring disclosure of “income (loss) from continuing operations” and “net income (loss)” where the existing rule previously required “income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.” This recommendation was based on a view that: (1) it was unclear what income statement line “income (loss)” referred to; and (2) the alternative formulation would highlight the effects of discontinued operations. Additionally, these commenters recommended that the Commission reconsider the per share financial metrics required to be disclosed in interim periods, such as the disclosure requirement in Item 302(a)(1) of Regulation S-K, <sup>474</sup> and make the metrics consistent with measures that are presented on the face of the interim income statements. One commenterexpressly supported the proposed amendments to retain the historical U.S. GAAP definition of “extraordinary expenses” in certain investment company registration forms. <sup>475</sup>

<h>c. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting the amendments as proposed, eliminating all references to extraordinary items and adding a definition of extraordinary expenses within certain N-Forms. We are also making several revisions recommended by commenters related to Item 302(a)(1). Specifically, we are replacing the proposed reference to “income (loss)” with “income (loss) from continuing operations” and the reference to “per share data based upon such income” with “per share data based upon income (loss) from continuing operations” <sup>476</sup> and “per share data based upon net income (loss).” These additional changes should help to simplify the resulting disclosure and reduce any confusion for issuers.

<h>6. Other</h>

See ASC 220-10-45-10A for additional items.

Commenters supported the proposed amendments. <sup>488</sup> We are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed.

<h>C. Disclosure Requirements Superseded by Other Commission Requirements</h>

Commission disclosure requirements have also changed over time, which has resulted in inconsistencies within our disclosure requirements. The Proposing Release identified disclosure requirements that have been superseded by other Commission disclosure requirements.

<h>1. Auditing Standards</h>

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections .

<h>a. Proposed Amendments</h>

Section 103(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act authorized the PCAOB to establish auditing and related professional practice standards used by registered public accounting firms when conducting audits of issuers. <sup>489</sup> Prior to the creation of the PCAOB, public accounting firms conducted audits of issuers pursuant to Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (“GAAS”) <sup>490</sup> and many Commission rules continue to refer to those standards. In addition, Section 10A of the Exchange Act also refers to GAAS in its requirements for audits. The standards of the PCAOB are different from GAAS.

In 2004, the Commission published interpretive guidance explaining that references to GAAS in Commission rules and staff guidance, as they relate to issuers, should be understood to mean the standards of the PCAOB plus any applicable rules of the Commission. <sup>491</sup> Further, the Commission stated its intent to codify this interpretation in the future. <sup>492</sup> The table below describes each of the disclosure requirements that the Commission proposed to amend as part of the codification. <sup>493</sup>

<h>b. Comments on Proposed Amendments</h>

Commenters generally supported these proposed amendments. <sup>494</sup> Some commenters <sup>495</sup>also recommended that the Commission clarify when a review of interim financial information inaccordance with PCAOB standards is not required under Rules 10-01 or 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Further, one of these commenters requested that we adopt a rule that explains which professional standards apply to every circumstance where financial statements are filed with the Commission. <sup>496</sup>

<h>c. Final Amendments</h>

We are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed. We are also eliminating the reference to U.S. standards for auditor independence from Instruction 2 to Item 8.A.2 of Form 20-F to be consistent with the amendments to Instruction E(c)(3) of Form20-F. We believe the reference to “applicable professional standards” in Rules 10-01 and 8-03 does not create significant confusion and therefore we are not adopting any amendments to clarify the application of these rules as suggested by commenters. Further, we are not adopting a rule that explains which professional standards apply to every circumstance where financial statements are filed with the Commission because that is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

<h>2. Other</h>

The table below describes each of the remaining superseded disclosure requirements that the Commission proposed to amend. <sup>497</sup>

Commenters supported the proposed amendments, <sup>501</sup> and no commenter specifically opposed the amendment. Accordingly, we are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed.

<h>D. Non-Existent or Incorrect References and Typographical Errors</h>

Various Commission disclosure requirements contain incorrect references or references to rules that no longer exist. The table below describes each of the disclosure requirements that contain these references and the related proposed amendments. <sup>502</sup>

Commenters supported the amendments to correct these references and errors, <sup>504</sup> and no commenter specifically opposed the amendments. Accordingly, we are adopting all of the amendments described in the table above as proposed.

Subsequent to the Proposing Release, we identified additional incorrect references or references to rules that no longer exist that also need to be updated, as well as typographical errors. We are amending our rules to address these incorrect references and errors in this release. We describe those amendments in the table below.

Reference to Rule 6-21(f) of Regulation S-X is made in Footnote 4 of both Rule 12-21 and Rule 12-22, and Footnote 5 of Rule 12-24. Reference to Rule 6-21 of Regulation S-X is made in Footnote 9 of Rule 12-23.

<h>VI. Other Matters</h>

If any of the provisions of these rules, or the application of these provisions to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.

<h>VII. Economic Analysis</h>

We are adopting amendments to certain of our disclosure requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or changes in the information environment. These amendments are the result of the staff’s ongoing evaluation of our disclosure requirements <sup>516</sup> and also are part of our efforts to implement Title LXXII, Section 72002(2) of the FAST Act.

We are sensitive to the costs and benefits of the amendments. In this section, we examine the current baseline, which consists of both the regulatory framework of disclosure requirements in existence today and the current use of such disclosure by investors and other users, and discuss the potential benefits and costs of the amendments, relative to this baseline, and their potential effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. <sup>517</sup>

The Proposing Release requested comment on all aspects of the economic effects of the proposed amendments, including the costs and benefits and possible alternatives to the proposed amendments. The Commission also solicited comment in the Proposing Release on whether theproposed amendments, if adopted, would promote efficiency, competition, or capital formation, or have an impact or burden on competition. We received a number of comments addressing the potential economic impacts of the proposed amendments, which we discuss below.

<h>A. Baseline and Affected Parties</h>

Our baseline includes the current disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K, Regulation S-X, and other Commission rules and forms promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Investment Company Act. The parties affected by the amendments include investors and other users, auditors, and issuers. Additionally, entities other than issuers may be affected (e.g., significant acquirees for which financial statements are required under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, significant equity method investees for which financial statements are required under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, broker-dealers, and NRSROs).

The amendments affect both domestic issuers and foreign private issuers. <sup>518</sup> We estimate that approximately 7,570 issuers that file on domestic forms <sup>519</sup> and 745 foreign private issuers that file on F-forms will be affected by the amendments. Among the issuers that file on domestic forms, 25.6% are large accelerated filers, 18.6% are accelerated filers, 19.3% are non-accelerated filers, and 36.2% are SRCs. About 23.7% of issuers that file on domestic forms are EGCs. <sup>520</sup>

Among the foreign private issuers that file on F-forms, 40.4% are large accelerated filers, 22.6% are accelerated filers, and 37.0% are non-accelerated filers. <sup>521</sup> About 19.8% of foreign private issuers that file on Forms 20-F and 40-F are EGCs. With respect to foreign private issuer accounting standards, approximately 38.5% of foreign private issuers report under U.S. GAAP, 60.5% report under IFRS, and approximately 1% report under Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting Principles with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

Certain amendments also affect requirements applicable to:

Fewer than 600 asset-backed issuing entities. <sup>522</sup>

Issuers that rely on Regulation A exemptions. <sup>523</sup>

Approximately 4,100 investment companies, including approximately 100 business development companies, and the portion of the approximately 12,600 investment advisers to which Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K apply. <sup>524</sup>

Up to approximately 3,883 registered broker-dealers. <sup>525</sup><sup>10</sup> NRSROs.

This release also considers certain Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP and refers some of these incremental requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. While a referral alone has no effect on issuers, any changes to U.S. GAAP that may result from such a referral would potentially affect all entities that report under U.S. GAAP, including SRCs and issuers relying on Regulation A or Regulation Crowdfunding, as well as entities that are outside the scope of our regulatory authority.

<h>B. Anticipated Benefits and Costs</h>

In this section, we discuss the anticipated economic benefits and costs of the amendments in each category of redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, and superseded disclosure requirements.

<h>1. Redundant or Duplicative Requirements</h>

We are eliminating certain Commission disclosure requirements that require substantially the same disclosures as U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements. In response to commenters’ suggestions, we are retaining some of the disclosure requirements that we proposed to modify or eliminate on the basis that they required redundant or duplicative disclosure and referring one of these disclosure requirements to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

Elimination of Commission disclosure requirements that are redundant or duplicative

The amendments to Part II of Form X-17A-5 affect up to approximately 467 broker-dealers, based on the number of broker-dealers who filed Part II as of December 31, 2017. The amendments to Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 affect approximately 3,413 broker-dealers, based on the number of broker-dealers who filed Part IIA as of December 31, 2017. The amendments to Part IIB of Form X-17A-5 affect approximately three broker-dealers, based on the number of broker-dealers who filed Part IIB as of March 31, 2018.with U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements simplifies issuer compliance efforts by reducing the number of rules to consider. To the extent that the redundant or duplicative requirements result in substantially the same disclosures, elimination of these requirements also potentially benefits investors and other users. Academic research suggests that duplication is associated with less efficient price discovery <sup>526</sup> and that individuals invest more in firms with more concise financial disclosures. <sup>527</sup> Thus, to the extent that the amendments alleviate duplication and do not affect the completeness of financial disclosures, <sup>528</sup> they could result in improved price discovery, enhance the allocative efficiency of the market, and facilitate capital formation.

The potential adverse effects of the amendments on investors and other users are likely to be limited as these parties would continue to receive substantially the same information from issuers. However, potential costs to investors may arise if U.S. GAAP were to change in such a way that information previously required by Commission disclosure requirements is no longer provided under U.S. GAAP. The potential for such changes may be mitigated by the FASB’s transparent, public standard-setting process and the Commission’s oversight of the FASB and the ability of the Commission to require such information through rulemaking. <sup>529</sup> In addition, issuers remain liable for their disclosures, including the omission of any information required to make the disclosures not misleading.

<h>2. Overlapping Requirements</h>

The Proposing Release identified Commission disclosure requirements that are related to, but not the same as, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements. For certain of these overlapping requirements, we are: (a) deleting the overlapping Commission disclosure requirements or (b) integrating them with other related Commission disclosure requirements. For certain other overlapping requirements, we are retaining the requirements and referring them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. We discuss below the economic effects of the amendments in this category and provide examples of requirements affected by the amendments.

First, some changes may give rise to Disclosure Location Considerations. Where we proposed to relocate existing disclosure from outside the financial statements to within the financial statements, a number of commenters expressed reservations about the relocation because it would create additional audit requirements for issuers. <sup>530</sup> Issuers may incur additional costs to comply with these audit and/or interim review and ICFR requirements, to the extent the relocation results in additional information included in the financial statements. A few commenters stated that investors would benefit from the annual audit and interim review of the disclosure. <sup>531</sup> Investors and other users may consider the information more reliable because of the audit and/or interim review requirements. <sup>532</sup>

The relocation of existing disclosures may affect the extent of information that investorsreceive. Since the PSLRA does not provide a safe harbor for forward-looking information located within the financial statements, issuers may be less likely to voluntarily supplement those disclosures with forward-looking information in the financial statements as compared with disclosures made outside the audited financial statements. A number of commenters expressed concern regarding liability issues for preparers that would arise from the loss of safe harbor provisions. <sup>533</sup> However, issuers retain the option of providing forward-looking information outside the financial statements and may be required to disclose the information in certain circumstances. <sup>534</sup>

The relocation of existing disclosures from outside the financial statements to within the financial statements will also subject the disclosures to XBRL tagging requirements.

Commenters expressed concern about XBRL tagging requirements because of additional administrative burdens and potential costs on issuers to comply with these requirements. <sup>535</sup> A few commenters believed that XBRL tagging requirements would be of benefit to investors. <sup>536</sup> Investors and other users may benefit from more readily-available information in structured formats because of the increased use of electronic data analysis and search tools. In general, we believe the costs of applying XBRL data tagging to additional information likely would be relatively low, as issuers already have implemented software enabled processes and controls tostructure previously mandated disclosures. <sup>537</sup>

Furthermore, the relocation of existing disclosures, for example, from outside the financial statements to within the financial statements or from the face of the financial statements to the notes to the financial statements, may also affect the prominence of the disclosures. Some academic research provides indirect evidence that users may treat information differently depending on the location of the disclosure. For instance, research shows a weaker relation between equity prices and disclosed items in the notes to the financial statements versus recognized items on the face of the financial statements. <sup>538</sup> Additionally, experimental research on laboratory participants shows that positioning pro-forma (non-GAAP) earnings earlier than/XBRL%20Costs%20for%20Small%20Companies.pdf. The incremental costs of tagging additional information under the amendments would be much lower and depend on the mix of incremental disclosures (e.g., narrative and numeric). The tagging cost associated with narrative disclosures would be minimal since these disclosures are tagged at the block text level and registrants already block tag other narrative disclosures in their filings. Numeric disclosures would need to be individually tagged, and therefore, any incremental costs would be directly associated with the volume of incremental numeric disclosures.

U.S. GAAP earnings in an earnings announcement influences a nonprofessional investor’s judgment. <sup>539</sup> Other research on the effect of disclosure location shows recognized and disclosed items are treated equivalently by investors. <sup>540</sup> Commenters that provided feedback on relocation prominence considerations indicated that physical location of the disclosure is less relevant in today’s environment, given the use of electronic data analysis and search tools. <sup>541</sup>

Second, besides the Disclosure Location Considerations discussed above, some deletions may change the mix of information available to investors. An example of this is the revision to require dividend restriction and related disclosures when material, rather than using the bright line of when restricted net assets exceed a 25 percent threshold. <sup>542</sup> Bright line thresholds set forth explicit quantitative criteria for disclosure and may result in more or less detail than a materiality standard. Several commenters were supportive of a more principles-based disclosure framework. <sup>543</sup> These commenters stated that materiality is a better disclosure standard because certain of the existing thresholds result in disclosure that in their view is immaterial to investors and costly to provide. Other commenters opposed the amendment, indicating that removingbright line thresholds may result in the elimination of disclosure relevant to investors or diminish comparability. <sup>544</sup>

The economic effect of replacing a bright line threshold with a disclosure standard based on materiality depends on the preferences of investors and other users. The bright line threshold may be easier to apply and could enhance the comparability and verifiability of information; however, a materiality standard may permit more tailored information to be presented and potentially avoid certain distortions that can arise from the use of a bright line threshold.

<h>a. Deletion of Commission Disclosure Requirements</h>

We are eliminating certain Commission disclosure requirements that we have determined: (1) require disclosures that convey reasonably similar information to or are encompassed by the disclosures that result from compliance with the overlapping U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or Commission disclosure requirements or (2) require disclosures incremental to the overlapping U.S. GAAP or Commission disclosure requirements and are no longer useful to investors.

The effects of the deletion of these overlapping disclosure requirements depend on the level of overlap between the requirements. For investors, eliminating overlapping requirements may reduce search costs and lead to more efficient information processing. This, in turn, may lead to better informed investment decisions and an increase in allocative efficiency. However, to the extent eliminating a requirement results in a loss of information incremental to the overlapping requirement, it could negatively impact investors that use the incremental information. For issuers, eliminating overlapping requirements may reduce the costs of preparation of the disclosure by reducing the need to reconcile similar requirements.

Requirements that are clearer and less repetitive may additionally make the disclosure easier to prepare and result in disclosure that is more responsive and easier to understand.

The examples below illustrate the potential effects of the elimination of Commission disclosure requirements on issuers, investors, and other users.

An example of an overlapping disclosure requirement that we are deleting because it results in only incremental disclosure is Item 101(d)(3) of Regulation S-K, which requires risk disclosures outside the financial statements relating to geographic areas. These disclosures are largely encompassed by the disclosures that result from compliance with other parts of Regulation S-K. More specifically, Item 101(d)(3) requires disclosure of “any” risks associated with an issuer’s foreign operations. Item 503(c) of Regulation S-K similarly requires disclosure of “significant” risk factors. Item 101(d)(3) also requires disclosures of a segment’s dependence on foreign operations, which is similar to the requirement in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K, requiring disclosure of trends and uncertainties by segment, if appropriate to an understanding of the issuer as a whole. We are also amending Item 303(a) to add an explicit reference to “geographic areas” to reduce the likelihood of loss of information due to the deletion of Item 101(d)(3).

Since Item 101(d)(3) is more expansive than the similar requirements in other parts of Regulation S-K, the economic effects of the deletion would depend on the nature of the incremental information required by Item 101(d)(3). Research shows that international corporate diversification may affect issuers’ stock market performance <sup>545</sup> and valuation. <sup>546</sup> Therefore,some investors may want incremental information on foreign operations that is not covered by the amended Item 303(a) or the requirements of Item 503(c) to disclose “significant” risk factors. Deletion of Item 101(d)(3) may adversely affect this group of investors. However, if the requirements in Item 101(d)(3), such as the requirement to disclose “any” risk associated with foreign operations, tend to yield immaterial disclosures, deletion of Item 101(d)(3) will benefit investors by eliminating immaterial information, reducing search costs, and facilitating more efficient information processing. <sup>547</sup> More efficient information processing could in turn result in improved price discovery and enhance the allocative efficiency of the capital markets. In addition, to the extent an issuer spends less time preparing its disclosures, investors will benefit from lower preparation costs although savings could be modest, if any. <sup>548</sup>

Another example of an overlapping disclosure requirement that involves incremental information is Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K. Instruction 5 to Item 303(b) requires seasonality disclosures outside of the financial statements in interim periods. U.S. GAAP similarly requires seasonality disclosures, but this disclosure is required in the notes to the interim financial statements. <sup>549</sup> Eliminating the specific seasonality disclosure requirements in Item 303(b) mayresult in the removal of this information from MD&A. Investors and other users will only have this disclosure available in the notes to the financial statements, unless issuers provide it in both locations either because the issuer views the seasonality disclosure as appropriate or necessary to an understanding of its business or financial condition under Item 303(a) or the issuer provides it voluntarily. In addition, investors may receive less supplemental forward-looking information about seasonality because the PSLRA safe harbor is not available for such information when it is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. To the extent that the seasonality disclosures in MD&A and in the financial statements are redundant, eliminating the requirements in Item 303(b) would reduce search costs and facilitate more efficient information processing. In addition, to the extent an issuer spends less time preparing its disclosures, investors will benefit from lower preparation costs although savings could be modest, if any. <sup>550</sup>

In addition to the economic effects of changing disclosure location and bright line disclosure thresholds, potential costs to investors may arise if U.S. GAAP were to change in such a way that information previously required by Commission disclosure requirements is no longer provided under U.S. GAAP. As noted above, the potential for such changes may be mitigated by the FASB’s transparent, public standard-setting process and the Commission’s oversight of the FASB.

<h>b. Integration of Commission Disclosure Requirements</h>

We are amending and integrating certain Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, other Commission disclosure requirements. In addition to the economic effects of changing disclosure location and bright line disclosureactivities, and should consider supplementing their interim reports with information for 12-month periods ended at the interim date for the current and preceding years.thresholds, integration of overlapping Commission disclosure requirements simplifies issuer compliance efforts by reducing the number of rules to consider and the extent of disclosures that need to be provided. Integration of these requirements should also facilitate more efficient information processing by investors.

One example to illustrate the potential effects of the integration of Commission disclosure requirements is Item 101(d)(4) of Regulation S-K. Item 101(d)(4) requires, when interim financial statements are presented, a discussion of the facts that indicate that the three- year financial data for geographic performance may not be indicative of current or future operations. This requirement is similar to requirements in Instruction 3 to Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K and Instruction 4 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K to identify elements of income which are not necessarily indicative of the issuer’s ongoing business, except that there is no explicit reference to “geographic areas” in the Item 303 instructions. To integrate the requirements into one location in Regulation S-K, we are eliminating Item 101(d)(4) and amending Item 303(a) to explicitly refer to “geographic areas” and clarify that the geographic discussion is required when management believes such discussion would be appropriate to an understanding of the business. A number of commenters supported the proposed amendment. <sup>551</sup> As noted above, integration of these requirements should facilitate more efficient information processing by investors. However, some investors may be adversely affected if they prefer geographic performance information to be presented with other business description disclosures.

<h>c. FASB Referral of Commission Disclosure Requirements</h>

We are referring certain Commission disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require information incremental to, U.S. GAAP requirements to the FASB for potentialincorporation into U.S. GAAP. While the referral alone has no direct impact on investors and issuers, any future FASB standard-setting activities, as well as any Commission rulemaking that may result from such a referral, could potentially affect investors, issuers, auditors, other users of financial statements, as well as other entities that report under U.S. GAAP. Any potential effects of standard-setting activities arising out of these referrals could be considered and taken into account by the Commission, and could be addressed through Commission rulemaking.

Additionally, the potential effects may be mitigated by the FASB’s transparent, public standard- setting process and the Commission’s oversight of the FASB.

<h>3. Outdated Requirements</h>

We are eliminating certain outdated Commission disclosure requirements that have become obsolete as a result of the passage of time or changes in the regulatory, business, or technological environment. Elimination of outdated disclosure requirements should simplify issuer compliance efforts by reducing the number of rules to consider and the extent of disclosures that need to be provided. In some cases, the amendments require additional disclosure of information to avoid any loss of information or decrease the burden for investors to retrieve such information from other sources. Such information is expected to be readily available at minimal to no cost to issuers.

The effect of these amendments on investors depends on the use of the information. If investors do not use the deleted information to make investment and voting decisions, these amendments may have little to no effect on investors, or the amendments may have a positive effect on investors since elimination of such disclosures may reduce search costs and facilitate more efficient information processing. This, in turn, could enhance the allocative efficiency of the market and facilitate capital formation. If the information is used by investors but can beretrieved from alternative sources with little or no cost to investors (e.g., share prices), <sup>552</sup> the effects of these amendments on investors should be minimal. In other cases where the information is less readily available from alternative sources (e.g., average exchange rates for each of the five most recent financial years and any subsequent interim period), <sup>553</sup> these amendments may make it more burdensome for investors and other users to access the information, with a potentially adverse effect on the cost of capital of issuers. We do not expect these potential adverse effects to be significant as the amendments delete only requirements that call for information that is either no longer relevant or is readily available or can be derived from alternative sources, and which may, in fact, be more robust than the information currently required to be disclosed. As noted above, some amendments require disclosure of additional information (e.g., the issuer’s Internet address, if available) to mitigate any loss of information or decrease the burden for investors.

One example of an outdated disclosure requirement is Item 201(a)(1) of Regulation S-K. Item 201(a)(1) requires the disclosure of historical market price information. We are substituting this disclosure with disclosure of the issuer’s ticker symbol, which can be used to obtain current and historical information on stock price, among other information. This additional disclosure may help reduce any loss of information as well as facilitate access to additional information while imposing minimal or no cost on issuers and saving them the expense of disclosing information that is readily available in more up-to-date form from alternative sources.

Commenters were generally supportive of this initiative to delete outdated requirements, <sup>554</sup> and specifically supported removing historical price information, noting that stock price informationis readily available on commercial websites on a more current basis than what is required by existing disclosure requirements. <sup>555</sup>

<h>4. Superseded Requirements</h>

We are amending certain Commission disclosure requirements to address inconsistencies that have arisen between existing Commission disclosure requirements and newer requirements, recent legislation, or more recently updated U.S. GAAP requirements.

Eliminating or amending superseded Commission disclosure requirements may simplify issuer compliance efforts by resolving some confusion for issuers. Where there are superseded requirements, issuers may need to expend time and resources seeking advice from outside professionals or guidance from Commission staff as to compliance with such requirements. To the extent that, in practice, many issuers already comply with the more recently adopted requirements, we expect these benefits to be modest. In addition, investors may benefit from the reduction in the variation of disclosure practices that could result from confusion about the superseded requirements among issuers.

One example of superseded disclosure is the requirement to report the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the income statement, which the FASB eliminated from

U.S. GAAP in 2005. <sup>556</sup> Instead, U.S. GAAP now requires the cumulative effect of retrospectively-applied changes in accounting principle to be reflected in the opening balance of retained earnings for the earliest period presented. The Commission disclosure requirements, by contrast, continue to refer to a line on the income statement for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Eliminating references to the cumulative effect of a change in accountingprinciple in the income statement in the Commission disclosure requirements resolves this contradiction and removes any resulting issuer confusion.

As another example, Rule 10-01(b)(2) of Regulation S-X requires, for interim periods, the presentation of dividends per share applicable to common stock on the face of the income statement. These rules are inconsistent with U.S. GAAP, which prohibits presentation of dividends per share on the face of the income statement. We are deleting Rule 10-01(b)(2) to conform to U.S. GAAP and simplify issuer compliance efforts.

In connection with this amendment and to avoid any loss of disclosure, we are extending the annual disclosure requirement of changes in stockholders’ equity in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim periods, which also requires disclosure of the amount of dividends per share for each class of shares, rather than only for common stock. As suggested by a few commenters, the final amendments clarify that Rule 3-04 requires both the year-to-date information and subtotals for each interim period. <sup>557</sup> Investors and other users may benefit from the additional information on dividends per share for each class of shares for interim periods. For example shareholders may use dividends to value an issuer. <sup>558</sup> Information about dividends also can be material for debtholders. <sup>559</sup> In addition, there may also be different dividend preferences based on aninvestor’s characteristics. <sup>560</sup>

These amendments may give rise to Disclosure Location Considerations, in that issuers will now disclose dividends either in the changes in stockholders’ equity statement or the notes to the financial statements to comply with Regulation S-X instead of on the face of the income statement. <sup>561</sup> Disclosing information on dividends issued and the relationship it has to stockholders’ equity in one location may help investors understand some of the strategic decisions made by management, such as dividend payout versus share buyback. The extension of the disclosure requirement in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X may create some additional burden for issuers, including Regulation A issuers, <sup>562</sup> because it requires disclosure of dividends per share for each class of shares, rather than only for common stock, and disclosure of changes in stockholders’ equity in interim periods. However, such costs should be limited to the extent that the required information is already available from the preparation of other aspects of the interim financial statements. Disclosure of this additional information may also lead to additional costs for issuers to comply with ICFR, audit, and XBRL tagging requirements, as applicable.

In the Proposing Release, we requested comments about other disclosure requirements that meet the criteria in any of the four sections of the release. Based on commenter responses and further internal review, we identified additional disclosure requirements that contained typographical errors, incorrect references, or references to rules that no longer exist. As a result, we are adopting additional conforming amendments, the majority of which are in the supersededcategory. These technical and conforming amendments should lower disclosure costs for issuers.

<h>C. Anticipated Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation</h>

The rules may improve capital allocation efficiency by enabling investors to make more efficient investment decisions. For example, the rules may reduce search costs for investors by eliminating information that is redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded.

Given that investors may have limited attention and limited information processing capabilities, elimination of such information may facilitate more efficient investment decision-making. In addition, elimination of these disclosure requirements may reduce issuer compliance costs and encourage capital formation. The reduction in compliance costs might be particularly beneficial for smaller and younger issuers that are resource constrained. A more efficient and less costly disclosure environment may make the public capital markets more competitive relative to private capital market alternatives and may additionally make the U.S. capital markets more competitive relative to markets in other countries. Although it is difficult to quantify these effects, to the extent that they are present, they may result in more public capital market investment opportunities for investors.

Eliminating information could result in increased information asymmetries between issuers and investors. Such asymmetries may increase the cost of capital, reduce capital formation, and hamper efficient allocation of capital across companies. To the extent that certain disclosure is no longer required, issuers for which this disclosure would be unfavorable may be less likely to disclose such information voluntarily. Even if other issuers do disclose such information voluntarily, it will be difficult to estimate the relative quality of issuers without every issuer’s disclosure. This will make it more difficult for higher quality issuers to distinguish their quality with respect to this metric even with voluntary disclosures. Suchnegative effects might be more pronounced among smaller and younger issuers that suffer morefrom information asymmetries. Overall, though, to the extent that we eliminate disclosure that we consider redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, we do not think these effects are likely to be significant.

<h>D. Alternatives</h>

We considered reasonable alternatives to the amendments. For redundant, duplicative, outdated, or superseded disclosure requirements being eliminated, we considered the alternative of retaining these requirements. However, as a general matter, given the nature of these requirements, we believe retaining the requirements could result in inefficiencies for investors, issuers, and others. For certain of the disclosure requirements that we proposed to modify or delete, where commenters indicated that the requirements may provide beneficial incremental disclosures for investors and other users, we are retaining the requirements and also are referring some of them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

For overlapping disclosure requirements, we solicited comments in the Proposing Release on certain requirements to determine whether to retain, modify, eliminate, or refer them to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP. After further consideration based on our review of the issues and consideration of the comments received, we are retaining all of the requirements discussed in Section III.D and referring all except one to the FASB for potential incorporation.

As an alternative to retaining these requirements, we could eliminate the Commission requirements and refer them to the FASB. This would deprive investors of any incremental disclosures elicited by the Commission requirements pending the FASB’s deliberations. If the disclosure requirements are ultimately added to U.S. GAAP, some information would be relocated from outside the financial statements to within the financial statements, giving rise to

Disclosure Location Considerations, potentially impacting issuers, investors, and other users. <sup>563</sup> Another alternative to retaining these requirements is to simply eliminate the Commission requirements and forgo disclosure of the incremental information without FASB referral.

Although such an alternative would simplify issuer compliance efforts, it also may result in less informed investment decisions and diminished investor protections.

<h>VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h>

<h>A. Background</h>

Certain provisions of our rules and forms that would be affected by the final amendments contain “collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). <sup>564</sup> The Commission published a notice requesting comment on the collection of information requirements in the Proposing Release and has submitted these requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA. <sup>565</sup> The titles for the affected collections of information are:

The majority of these regulations, schedules, and forms were adopted under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and/or the Investment Company Act and set forth the disclosure requirements for registration statements, periodic reports, and proxy and information statements filed by issuers to help investors make informed investment and voting decisions. Certain otherforms and reports are filed by broker-dealers, entities regulated by the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, and NRSROs in connection with the Commission’s oversight of such entities.

These amendments are the result of the staff’s ongoing evaluation of our disclosure requirements <sup>567</sup> and also are part of our efforts to implement Title LXXII, Section 72002(2) of the FAST Act.

The hours and costs associated with preparing, filing, and sending the schedules and forms constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to comply with, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Compliance with the information collections is mandatory. Responses to the information collections are not kept confidential, and there is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed.

<h>B. Summary of the Final Amendments</h>

As described in more detail above, we are adopting amendments to certain of our disclosure requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or changes in the information environment.

By eliminating the redundancy, duplication, and overlap in current Commission disclosure requirements, we are enabling respondents to consider fewer rules and requirements in their compliance efforts even as they are preparing a substantially similar level of disclosures.

As such, except for the amendment to eliminate the requirement to disclose the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, which may result in a modest decrease in the paperwork burden, we believe thatthe amendments to eliminate these redundant, duplicative, and overlapping Commission requirements would marginally reduce, if at all, respondents’ overall paperwork burden.

Similarly, we expect that the amendments to eliminate outdated requirements would marginally reduce the paperwork burden on respondents by eliminating any efforts that were undertaken to prepare these disclosures. With the exception of the amendments to require the disclosure of an issuer’s website address and the ticker symbol of their common equity that is publicly traded, which will slightly increase the paperwork burden, the remaining amendments related to outdated requirements would have no change or only a modest reduction in the paperwork burden when respondents are providing information in response to Forms 10, 10-K, 20-F, S-1, and F-1.

Finally, we believe that the amendments to update superseded Commission disclosure requirements would marginally reduce, if at all, respondents’ paperwork burden, except for the extension of the application of Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim period disclosures, <sup>568</sup> which we estimate will modestly increase the paperwork burden. While the amendments eliminate any existing confusion related to contradictory and inconsistent requirements, in many instances, we believe respondents are currently not providing information in response to the requirements that we are deleting. Instead, we believe respondents provide information in response to U.S. GAAP or other Commission disclosure requirements that have been updated more recently, rather than the superseded requirement covered by the amendments. As a result, we do not believe the majority of these amendments would result in a change to respondents’ overall paperwork burden.

In light of the foregoing, our estimates for the paperwork burden for a number of the collections of information have not changed. The tables below therefore do not reflect any change in the paperwork burden for the following collections of information: Rules 405 and 436 of Regulation C and Forms F-6, F-7, F-8, F-10, F-80, 1-K under the Securities Act; Exchange Rules 10A-1, 12b-2, 15c3-1g, 17a-5, 17h-1T and Forms 40-F, 11-K, 10-D, X-17A-5 under the Exchange Act; Forms N-5, N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, N-6, N-8B-2 under the Investment Company Act; and Schedules 14A and 14C under the Exchange Act.

<h>C. Summary of Comment Letters and Revisions to Proposals</h>

In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on our PRA burden hour and cost estimates and the analysis used to derive such estimates. We did not receive any comments that addressed our PRA analysis of the proposed amendments.

We did make some changes to the proposed amendments as a result of comments received, but we do not expect any of those changes to affect the compliance burdens of the existing collections of information, and therefore we are not revising our PRA burden hour and cost estimates as a result of these changes.

<h>D. Burden and Cost Estimates</h>

As noted above, we do not believe that the overwhelming majority of the amendments will result in a change to respondents’ overall paperwork burden. In this subsection we discuss the few amendments that will result in a change to respondents’ overall paperwork burden.1. Forms 10, 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, and 1-SA

We anticipate that the amendments to eliminate the requirement to disclose the market prices for an issuer’s common equity for the two most recent fiscal years will modestly reduce affected issuers’ current paperwork burdens. We estimate that issuers currently expend an average of two hours internally preparing the market price disclosure for inclusion in their Forms10-K and 20-F. As such, we estimate that affected issuers would experience a two hour reduction in their annual paperwork burden. <sup>569</sup> We also estimate that there are 8,862 annual responses made in connection with Forms 10-K and 20-F. The table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing Forms 10-K and 20-F as a result of these amendments.

Table 1.

The amendments will extend to interim periods the requirements under Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to disclose changes in stockholders’ equity and dividends per share for each class of shares, rather than only for common stock. Prior to these amendments, these disclosures were not required for interim periods. While this creates a new disclosure requirement for respondents, the information being required is generally readily available from respondents’ preparation of other aspects of the interim financial statements. As a result, we estimate that this amendment will increase the average paperwork burdens by 0.5 hours each time such disclosure is required. <sup>570</sup> We also estimate that there are 23,159 annual responses in connection with Forms10, 10-Q, and 1-SA. The table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing Forms 10, 10-Q, and 1-SA as a result of the proposed application of Rule 3-04 to interim period disclosures. <sup>571</sup>

Table 2.2. Forms S-1, S-3, S-4, S-11, SF-1, SF-3, F-1, F-3, F-4, and 1-A

We anticipate that the amendments to eliminate the market prices disclosure will have the same paperwork burden reduction for Forms S-1, S-4, S-11, F-1, and F-4 as for Forms 10-K and 20-F. <sup>572</sup> As such, we estimate that there will be a corresponding reduction in the burden estimate for these forms. <sup>573</sup> We estimate that there are approximately 1,618 annual responses made in connection with the referenced forms. The table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing the referenced forms as a result of these amendments.

Table 3.10s and 20-F, to the extent that interim period disclosures are made, the issuer would experience an increase in paperwork burden.

The amendments to extend Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim periods will also impact the paperwork burdens of registration statements filed on Forms 1-A, S-1, S-4, S-11, F-1, and F-4 because such forms require interim period financial disclosures, when applicable. <sup>574</sup> We believe that the estimated burden increase of 0.5 hours discussed above similarly applies to the referenced registration statements. We estimate that there are approximately 1,730 annual responses made in connection with the referenced forms. The table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing the referenced forms as a result of these amendments.

The amendment to eliminate the requirements to disclose the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, when an issuer registers debt securities, and the ratio of combined fixed charges and preference dividends to earnings, when an issuer registers preference securities, will reduce the current paperwork burden for issuers registering such securities on Forms S-1, S-3, S-4, S-11, F-1, F-3 and F-4. Depending on the size and complexity of the issuer, the paperwork burden associated with preparing this information for inclusion in the aforementioned registration statements can vary greatly. We estimate that issuers expend an average of four hours preparing this disclosure for inclusion in their registration statements. For the purposes of this analysis, we assume that the ratio is prepared internally, and we have estimated that there are approximately 1,722 annual responses made in connection with the referenced forms. Based on this average, the table below illustrates the overall impact on respondents filing the referenced forms as a result of the amendments.

<h>IX. Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</h>

This Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“FRFA”) has been prepared in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”). <sup>576</sup> This FRFA relates to final amendments that will eliminate certain Commission disclosure requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or changes in the information environment. These amendments are the result ofthe staff’s ongoing evaluation of our disclosure requirements <sup>577</sup> and also are part of our efforts to implement Title LXXII, Section 72002(2) of the FAST Act.

<h>A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Amendments</h>

The main purpose of the amendments is to update and simplify the Commission’s current disclosure requirements. Specifically, the amendments will:

Eliminate certain Commission disclosure requirements that are redundant or duplicative of requirements in U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or other Commission disclosure requirements.

Streamline certain overlapping Commission disclosure requirements by deleting or integrating provisions that address disclosure topics covered elsewhere in our rules or regulations.

Revise certain Commission disclosure requirements that are outdated.

Revise certain superseded Commission disclosure requirements to update and conform these provisions with recent legislation, more recently updated Commission disclosure requirements, or more recently updated U.S. GAAP requirements.

The need for, and objectives of, the final amendments are discussed in more detail throughout this release, particularly in Section I, above.

<h>B. Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments</h>

In the Proposing Release we requested comment on any aspect of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”), including the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed amendments, the nature of the impact, how to quantify the number of small entities that would be affected, and how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments. We did notreceive comments specifically addressing the IRFA or the proposed amendments’ impact on small entities.

<h>C. Small Entities Subject to the Amendments</h>

The amendments will affect some small entities that file registration statements under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Investment Company Act and periodic reports, proxy and information statements, or other reports under the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. In addition, the amendments will affect some small entities that are not reporting companies and that issue securities under Regulation A exemption. The RFA defines “small entity” to mean “small business,” “small organization,” or “small governmental jurisdiction.” <sup>578</sup>

For purposes of the RFA, under 17 CFR 230.157 (“Securities Act Rule 157”), an issuer, other than an investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of securities not exceeding $5 million. Under 17 CFR 240.0- 10(a) (“Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a)”), an issuer, other than an investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year.	In total, we estimate that there are approximately 1,233 issuers, other than investment companies, that may be considered small entities and will be subject to the amendments. <sup>579</sup>

An investment company, including a business development company, is considered to be a “small business,” for the purposes of the RFA, if it, together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year. <sup>580</sup> We estimate that there are approximately 112 investment companies, including 18 business development companies, that will be subject to the amendments that may be considered small entities. <sup>581</sup>

For the purposes of the RFA, an investment adviser generally is a small entity if it: (1) has assets under management having a total value of less than $25 million; (2) did not have total assets of $5 million or more on the last day of the most recent fiscal year; and (3) does not control, is not controlled by, and is not under common control with another investment adviser that has assets under management of $25 million or more, or any person (other than a natural person) that had total assets of $5 million or more on the last day of its most recent fiscal year. <sup>582</sup> We estimate that there are approximately 447 investment advisers that will be subject to the amendments that may be considered small entities. <sup>583</sup>

For the purposes of the RFA, a broker-dealer is considered to be a “small business” if its total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) is less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d)under the Exchange Act, <sup>584</sup> or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and that is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization. <sup>585</sup> We estimate there are approximately 1,042 broker-dealers that may be considered small entities. Of these, nine were Part II filers and 1,033 were Part IIA filers. <sup>586</sup>

The Commission has previously stated, and we continue to believe, that an NRSRO with total assets of $5 million or less would qualify as a “small” entity for purposes of the RFA. <sup>587</sup> Currently, there are 10 NRSROs and, based on their most recently filed annual reports pursuant to Rule 17g-3, two NRSROs are small entities under the above definition and will be subject to the amendments.

<h>D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements</h>

As noted above, the final amendments update and simplify the Commission’s disclosure requirements and do not impose any significant new disclosure obligations. While there are no particular professional skills that are required to comply with the amendments, the professional skills necessary for complying with an issuer’s disclosure obligations as a whole may include legal, accounting, or information technology skills. As adopted, the amendments address requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded inlight of other Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or changes in the information environment. We expect these amendments to reduce slightly the existing reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance burdens for all issuers, including small entities.

The amendments are discussed in detail in Sections II, III, IV, and V, above. We discuss the economic impact, including the estimated compliance costs and burdens, of the amendments in Section VII (Economic Analysis) and Section VIII (Paperwork Reduction Act) above.

<h>E. Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities</h>

The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on small entities. In connection with the final amendments, we considered the following alternatives: (1) establishing different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements for small entities; (3) using performance rather than design standards; and (4) exempting small entities from coverage of all or part of the proposed amendments.

With respect to clarification, consolidation, and simplification of compliance and reporting requirements for small entities, the amendments do not impose any significant new disclosure obligations, and they reduce other disclosure obligations. As noted above, the amendments address certain of our disclosure requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded, in light of other Commission disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or changes in the information environment. The amendments will clarify, consolidate, and simplify compliance for all issuers, including small entities.

For similar reasons, we do not believe it is necessary, and indeed would be contrary to the stated objectives of the amendments, to establish different compliance or reporting requirementsor timetables or to exempt small entities from all or part of the amendments. <sup>588</sup> The Commission’s existing disclosure requirements provide for scaled disclosure requirements and other accommodations for SRCs and EGCs, and the amendments would not alter these existing accommodations.

Finally, with respect to use of performance rather than design standards, the amendments to eliminate certain prescriptive Commission rules that call for information that overlaps with information required by U.S. GAAP or revise certain prescriptive rules to streamline our disclosure requirements may result in issuers, including small entities, being provided with additional flexibility when preparing their disclosures. For instance, existing Rule 4-08(e)(3) requires disclosure of dividend restrictions and related disclosures when restricted net assets exceed 25 percent. As amended, the rule will require such disclosure when it is material and not based on a bright line threshold. While not all amendments use performance standards, many would have a similar effect—namely, to provide issuers, including small entities, with additional flexibility to present more tailored disclosures without meaningfully reducing the total mix of information provided to investors.

9 In this release, we refer to such requirements as “incremental” Commission disclosure requirements.

10 We refer to the proposed amendments and this additional comment solicitation collectively as “proposals.”

11 The Supreme Court has held that a fact is material if there is “a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.” See TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976).

12 The staff, under its Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, is reviewing the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X and is considering ways to improve the disclosure regime for the benefit of both companies and investors. The goal is to comprehensively review the requirements and make recommendations on how to update them to facilitate timely, material disclosure by companies and investors’ access to that information.

13 Pub. L. No. 114-94

14 Under Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 [17 CFR 240.12b-2], a large accelerated filer is an issuer with an aggregate worldwide market value of voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of

15 Under Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, an accelerated filer is an issuer with an aggregate worldwide market value of voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million, as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. In addition, the issuer needs to have been subject to reporting requirements for at least twelve calendar months, have filed at least one annual report, and not be eligible to use the requirements for smaller reporting companies for its annual and quarterly reports.

16 Although the term “non-accelerated filer” is not defined in Commission rules, we use it throughout this release to refer to a reporting company that does not meet the definition of either an “accelerated filer” or a “large accelerated filer” under Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.

17 An EGC is an issuer with less than $1.07 billion in total annual gross revenues during its most recently completed fiscal year. If an issuer qualifies as an EGC on the first day of its fiscal year, it maintains that status until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it has total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (2) the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of its common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; (3) the date on which the issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt; or (4) the date on which the issuer is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2). See Rule 405 of Regulation C under the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

18 An SRC is an issuer that had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.

19 See Rule 405 of Regulation C and Exchange Act Rule 3b-4(c) [17 CFR 240.3b-4(c)]. A foreign private issuer is any foreign issuer other than a foreign government, except for an issuer that has more than 50 percent of its outstanding voting securities held of record by U.S. residents and any of the following: a majority of its officers or directors are citizens or residents of the United States; more than 50 percent of its assets are located in the United States; or its business is principally administered in the United States.

20 Foreign private issuers may only use the scaled rules available to SRCs if they file on domestic forms under

21 Domestic issuers include foreign issuers that do not meet the definition of foreign private issuer.

22 Throughout this release, we refer to a comprehensive body of accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP or IFRS as “Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting Principles.”

23 Foreign private issuers that report under IFRS must comply with the IFRS requirements for the form and content of financial statements, rather than with the specific presentation and disclosure provisions in Articles 3A, 4, 5, 6, 6A, 7, 8, 9, 10, and certain parts of Article 3 of Regulation S-X. Where an amendment to Regulation S-X also affects foreign private issuers that report under IFRS, we discuss both U.S. GAAP and IFRS.

24 For example, these forms include Forms F-1, F-3, F-4, and 20-F.

25 “Asset-backed issuer” is defined in Item 1101(b) of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1101(b)]. See the amendments regarding: (1) invitations for competitive bids discussed in Section III.B.2, (2) available information discussed in Section IV.C.2, (3) matters submitted to a vote of security holders discussed in Section V.C.2, and (4) incorrect references in General Instruction J(1)(e) to Form 10-K discussed in Section V.D.

26 See Rules 251 – 263 of Regulation A [17 CFR 230.251 – 230.263]. Regulation A is an exemption from Securities Act registration for offerings by issuers that comply with the requirements of the exemption. A Tier 1 offering under Regulation A limits the sum of the aggregate offering price and the aggregate sales within 12 months before the start of the offering to $20 million, while a Tier 2 offering limits that sum to

27 Only U.S. and Canadian issuers may rely on Regulation A and use Form 1-A. See Rule 251(b)(1) of Regulation A [17 CFR 230.251(b)(1)]. U.S. issuers must report under U.S. GAAP. Canadian issuers may report under U.S. GAAP or IFRS. See paragraph (a)(2) of Part F/S of Form 1-A, Item 7(b) of Form 1-K, and Item 3 of Form 1-SA.

28 Statements about the effect of an amendment on Regulation A issuers throughout this release reflect that the form and content requirements in Regulation S-X do not apply to Canadian Regulation A issuers that report under IFRS. Please refer to Section V.C.2.

45 See section 19 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.77s].

46 Section 108 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act amended section 19 of the Securities Act to provide that the Commission “may recognize, as ‘generally accepted’ for purposes of the securities laws, any accounting principles established by a standard setting body that met certain criteria.” The Commission has determined that the FASB satisfies the criteria in section 19 and, accordingly, the FASB’s financial accounting and reporting standards are recognized as “generally accepted” for purposes of the federal securities laws. See 2003 FASB Policy Statement.

47 See See also pages 2 and 5 of the FASB Rules of Procedures, available at Page&cid=1176162391050.

48 The 2003 FASB Policy Statement describes the Commission’s three key expectations for the FASB. First, the FASB shall consider, in adopting accounting principles, the extent to which international convergence on high quality accounting standards is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, including consideration of moving towards greater reliance on principles-based accounting standards whenever it is reasonable to do so. Second, the FASB shall take reasonable steps to continue to improve the timeliness with which it completes its projects, while satisfying appropriate public notice and comment requirements. Last, the FASB shall continue to be objective in its decision-making and to weigh carefully the views of its constituents and the expected benefits and perceived costs of each standard.

49 See, e.g., Rule 4-08(h) of Regulation S-X, parts of which were subsequently incorporated into U.S. GAAP.

50 See, e.g., Rule 10-01(a)(7) of Regulation S-X, which refers to the disclosures required by ASC 915 on development stage entities, which the FASB has since eliminated.

51 See, e.g., General Revision of Regulation S-X, Release No. 33-6233 (Sept. 2, 1980) [45 FR 63660 (Sept. 25, 1980)], Phase One Recommendations of Task Force on Disclosure Simplification Release No. 33-7300 (May 31, 1996) [61 FR 30397 (June 14, 1996)], and Technical Amendments to Rules, Forms, Schedules, and Codification of Financial Reporting Policies, Release No. 33-9026, (Apr. 15, 2009) [74 FR 18612 (Apr. 23, 2009)].

53 For example, Rules 8-03(b)(5) and 10-01(b)(7) of Regulation S-X both require disclosure of the effect of changes in reporting entities on net income and per share amounts in interim periods. However, Rule 10- 01(b)(7) incrementally requires, for non-SRCs, disclosure of the effect on retained earnings.

56 See letter from ABA. The FASB scopes financial accounting and reporting for companies by (1) public business entities (PBEs); (2) not-for-profit entities; and (3) all other entities. The definition of PBEs encompasses an entity that “(a) is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file or furnish financial statements, or does file or furnish financial statements (including voluntary filers), with the SEC (including other entities whose financial statements or financial information are required to be or are included in a filing).” This definition is broader than entities with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act. For example, a privately-owned entity meets the definition of a PBE if it is acquired by a registrant and its financial statements are required under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. See FASB’s Accounting Standards Update 2013-12, Definition of a Public Business Entity.

57 See further discussion in Sections II and III below.

See ment_C%2FDocumentPage.

59 See Section II.B of the 2003 FASB Policy Statement.

60 We recognize that the FASB will need to expend time and resources to consider the referrals we are making in this release, in addition to carrying out its other standard-setting activities. We believe that 18 months should provide sufficient time for the FASB to appropriately consider these referrals without imposing undue constraints on the FASB’s current standard-setting agenda. Any impact to the FASB’s current operations, as a result of the referrals described in this release, including any potential change to its annual budget and related accounting support fee paid for by issuers, could depend on how much overlap there is with existing FASB projects and how the FASB allocates its resources. See Section 109(e) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

79 ASC 235-10-50 requires identification and description of the accounting principles followed by an issuer and the methods of applying those principles that materially affect the determination of financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

80 For example, as discussed in Section III.B.2, our amendments eliminate the disclosures about an issuer’s status as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) in the audited notes to the financial statements, in reliance on required disclosures within the same filing, but outside the audited financial statements.

99 ASC 810-10-45-12 uses the phrase “about three months” instead of 93 days.

100 Rule 3A-02(d) requires due consideration of the propriety of consolidation in the presence of political, economic, or currency restrictions. ASC 810-10-15-10 states that subsidiaries shall not be consolidated in the presence of foreign exchange restrictions, controls, or other governmentally imposed uncertainties so severe that they cast significant doubt on the parent’s ability to control the subsidiary.

101 Rule 3A-02 states that the accounting policy disclosure should also include the circumstances associated with any departure from the normal practice of consolidating majority owned subsidiaries and not consolidating entities that are not majority owned. ASC 235-10-50-1 states that the accounting disclosure shall encompass important judgments about the appropriateness of accounting principles and unusual or innovative applications of U.S. GAAP.

102 ASC 855-10-50-2 requires disclosure of events subsequent to the balance sheet date that are of such a nature that non-disclosure would render the financial statements misleading. ASC 855-10-55-55-2a provides that the sale of a bond subsequent to the balance sheet date is an example of such a subsequent event.

103 For compensatory warrants or rights, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the nature and terms of such arrangements, the number and weighted-average exercise price, and the weighted-average contractual term.

104 Compensatory warrants and rights are those issued to an employee, non-employee or other entity for supply of goods or services for the issuer’s benefit, whereas non-compensatory warrants and rights are those issued for all other reasons.

105 This rule specifically applies to SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP.

134 U.S. GAAP requires that its minimum disclosure requirements about transactions such as repurchase agreements be supplemented as necessary to meet certain disclosures objectives (e.g., providing investors with an understanding of how transfers of financial assets affect an issuer’s financial statements) and aggregation principles (e.g., presentation in a manner that clearly and fully explains the transferor’s risk exposure related to the transferred financial assets and any restrictions on the assets of the entity). See ASC 860-10-50.

135 See Rules 4-08(m)(1)(ii)(A)(i) and 4-08(m)(1)(ii)(B) of Regulation S-X. These rules, however, do not require disclosure of the carrying amount and market value of securities and other assets for which unrealized changes in market value are reported in current income or which have been obtained under reverse repurchase agreements. This scope is narrower than that for the U.S. GAAP requirement to separately present carrying amounts, which applies to all assets sold under repurchase agreements.

137 Specifically, Regulation S-X requires the tabular disclosures if the aggregate carrying amount (or market value, if higher than the carrying amount) of the securities or other assets sold under repurchase agreements exceeds 10 percent of total assets. The amount of securities or other assets sold under repurchase agreements excludes securities and other assets for which unrealized changes in market value are reported in current income or have been obtained under reverse repurchase agreements

In this adopting release, the Commission stated that in the absence of comprehensive accounting literature, registrants have developed accounting practices for options and complex derivatives by analogy to the limited amount of literature that does exist. The Commission also noted that those analogies are complicated because, under existing accounting literature, there are at least three distinctively different methods of accounting for derivatives (e.g. fair value accounting, deferral accounting, and accrual accounting). The Commission further observed that the underlying concepts and criteria used in determining the applicability of those accounting methods is not consistent.

U.S. GAAP also requires disclosure of amounts not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because exercise or conversion of the securities would have had an antidilutive effect in the period. In aggregate, these amounts may be similar to, but not the same as, those required by Item 201(a)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K, as U.S. GAAP determines the incremental shares as a weighted average based on the period outstanding during the year and assumes that cash received from the assumed exercise or conversion is used to repurchase outstanding shares.

205 Other variations of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges include alternative earnings measures such as earnings before interest and taxes and alternative fixed charges measures such as total lease payments and one-third of lease payments (to approximate the interest component in lease payments).

206 The interest coverage ratio is often calculated as earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest payments.

207 The debt-service coverage ratio is often calculated as operating income divided by total debt service.

208 In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases, which is effective on January 1, 2019, with early application permitted in certain circumstances. Under IFRS 16, interest expense will be recognized for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU No. 2016-02”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early application permitted. Under ASU No. 2016-02, leases with a term of more than 12 months will be classified into one of two types, with one type requiring recognition of an interest expense component (a finance lease) and the other type requiring recognition of lease expense without separate recognition of interest expense (an operating lease). Like IFRS 16, interest expense will not be recognized on leases with a term less than 12 months. Interested parties may still need to estimate the portion of lease expense that is viewed to represent interest for operating leases in order to determine the components of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, which will be facilitated by disclosure of the weighted-average discount rate for operating leases required by ASU No. 2016-02.

209 See Gerald T. Nowak P.C., Negotiating the High-Yield Indenture, (Feb. 17, 2009), available at (noting that a typical high-yield credit agreement might require the debtor to maintain a certain level of revenue or a certain ratio of earnings to fixed charges). See also Li, Ningzhoung, Performance Measures in Earnings-Based Financial Covenants in Debt Contracts, LONDON BUS. SCH. (2011) available at f (noting that fixed charge coverage covenants are common in loan documents).

210 One commenter on the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative stated: “Many of [the financial metrics debt investors use to evaluate an issuer’s financial position and liquidity] are reflected in the measures of performance or liquidity that are defined in the issuers’ debt instruments. For investors in such instruments, a metric that is tied to a contractually defined covenant test is more useful than the SEC-mandated disclosure. Importantly, our experience is that market participants in unregistered debt offerings – initial purchasers as well as institutional investors – do not generally request or require that the SEC-prescribed ratio of earnings to fixed charges be included in the offering document; instead, issuers disclose one or more interest coverage ratios or similar financial metrics that are calculated with reference to the instruments governing the securities being offered.” See letter from ABA Committee (Mar. 6, 2015), available at https://

212 The Commission additionally proposed conforming revisions to Item 503(e), Item 601(c), the Exhibit Table in Item 601, Item 1010(a)(3), Item 1010(b)(2), Item 1010(c)(4), Item 3 of Form S-1, Item 3 of Form S-3, Item 3 of Form S-4, Item 3 of Form S-11, Item 3 of Form F-1, Item 3 of Form F-3, and Item 3 of Form F-4.

217 Item 504 of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of the principal purposes for which the net proceeds to the registrant from the securities to be offered are intended to be used and the approximate amount intended to be used for each such purpose. In addition, Instruction 4 of Item 504 of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of the interest rate and maturity of such indebtedness, if any material part of the proceeds is to be used to discharge indebtedness.

220 As described in the Proposing Release, REITs are not subject to entity-level taxation on the amounts distributed to their investors. Rather, their investors are liable for taxes on these distributions, depending on the character of the dividends (i.e., ordinary income, capital gains, or return of capital) the REIT distributes to them. Because the amount of undistributed gains or losses required by Rule 3-15(a)(2) of Regulation S-X is not presented on a tax basis, this disclosure does not provide investors with insight into the tax implications of the REIT’s distributions.

231 Items 101(a)(1), 503(c), and 303(a)(3)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

232 For REITs, the primary assumption in making or not making federal income tax provisions is the issuer’s continued REIT status and its consideration of the risks affecting its continued REIT status. Therefore, the Regulation S-K requirement to disclose significant risk factors and a description of known uncertainties that are reasonably expected to have a material effect on income elicit this information. In addition, issuers often repeat or expand on the Regulation S-X disclosures in their risk factor disclosures.

233 In this release, we are adopting amendments to Rule 8-03 and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X to mandate that Rule 3-04 be applied to interim periods. See Section V.B.2 below.

234 The Commission also proposed to delete its accompanying reference in the Exhibit Table within Item 601.

241 For example, Article 8 and Article 10 of Regulation S-X permit the presentation of condensed financial statements, do not require audits of interim financial statements, allow issuers to assume that a user has read the preceding year’s audited financial statements, permit omission of details of accounts that have not changed significantly since the audited balance sheet date, and permit omission of the disclosures required by Rule 4-08 of Regulation S-X.

242 For example, SRCs are required to present two, rather than three, years of financial statements and are not required to present selected financial data in accordance with Item 301 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.301].

243 Rule 11-01(a) and Rule 11-02(b)(7) of Regulation S-X. [17 CFR 210.11-01(a)].

244 For example, for a significant acquisition that occurs on September 1, 2015, the Form 8-K would contain pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Under Rule 8-03(b)(4) and Rule 10-01(b)(4), however, the Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 would be required to include pro forma disclosures for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014.

In contrast, Rule 8-03(b)(4) would require pro forma disclosures in the September 30, 2017 interim financial statements, filed on Form 10-Q by November 16, 2017, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, as if the disposal had occurred at the beginning of each period presented.

263 Specifically, Instruction 4 of Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K, which addresses interim periods, requires that the registrant’s discussion of material changes in results of operations shall identify any significant elements of the registrant’s income or loss from continuing operations which do not arise from or are not necessarily representative of the registrant’s ongoing business. The introductory paragraph to Item 303(b) also states that the interim discussion and analysis shall include a discussion of material changes in those items specifically listed in paragraph (a) of the Item. Since paragraph (a) indicates that, where in a registrant’s judgment a discussion of segment information or of other subdivisions of the registrant’s business would be appropriate to an understanding of such business, the discussion shall focus on each relevant, reportable segment or other subdivision of the business and on the registrant as a whole, the requirement in Item 101(b)(2) of Regulation S-K is duplicative of Item 303 requirements.

300 See letter from E&Y. We considered the recommendation to reorganize Rule 3-20 of Regulation S-X and move certain disclosure requirements to Item 303 of Regulation S-K but are not adopting the recommended amendments as they could have implications that go beyond the scope of this rulemaking and would merit further consideration.

301 The staff has not objected to domestic issuers and foreign issuers who do not meet the foreign private issuer definition from using a different reporting currency in situations where the issuer had few or no assets and operations in the U.S., substantially all the operations were conducted in a single functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, and the reporting currency selected was the same as the functional currency.

302 These proposed amendments are discussed in further detail in Section III.D.2 of the Proposing Release.

303 In lieu of disclosure, Item 201(c)(1) permits a cross-reference to this information in the disclosures required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X.

305 This amendment gives rise to Bright Line Disclosure Threshold Considerations and Disclosure Location – Financial Statement Considerations discussed in Section I.E above (See also Section III.B.2 of the Proposing Release, supra note 1, at 51616).

306 We did not propose and are not changing the requirements in Rules 5-04, 7-05, and 9-06 for parent only financial information.

307 The definitions of terms used in Regulation S-X are located in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X..

308 Foreign private issuers that report under U.S. GAAP or Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting Principles with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP must comply with Rule 4-08(e). Foreign private issuers that report under IFRS must comply with paragraph 79(a)(v) of IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, which requires disclosure of restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the repayment of capital for each class of share capital.

309 Although this requirement is similar to Rule 4-08(e), which creates some duplication for foreign private issuers that report under U.S. GAAP or Another Comprehensive Body of Accounting Principles with a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, the Commission did not propose its deletion because IFRS does not contain an equivalent requirement for foreign private issuers that report under IFRS.

Item 1, Instruction 1 and Item 8.5(b) of Form N-2. In addition to these requirements, Form N-2 requires disclosure of information relating to net asset value and discount or premium to net asset value. Item 8.5(b), Instructions 4 and 5 and Item 8.5(c) through (e) of Form N-2. Disclosure of sales prices and bid information is needed in registration statements on Form N-2 so that the required premium/discount disclosure can be fully understood. Accordingly, the Commission did not propose to change the requirements in Form N-2 relating to sales prices and bid information.

We do not expect the amendments to conform these requirements to U.S. GAAP to cause confusion for issuers that report under IFRS because U.S. GAAP and IFRS are substantially converged for these topics.

430 For example, Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements (“ARB No. 51”), was issued in 1959. Since then, the FASB has issued additional guidance, including but not limited to SFAS No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries – an amendment of ARB No. 51, with related amendments of APB Opinion No. 18 and ARB No. 43, Chapter 12; FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities – an interpretation of ARB No. 51; FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities – an interpretation of ARB No. 51; SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R); and ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.

431 These proposed amendments are discussed in further detail in Section V.B.4. of the Proposing Release.

432 Regulation S-X prohibits the consolidation of an entity if its fiscal period differs substantially, for example by more than 93 days, from that of the issuer.

433 Regulation S-X permits the combination of entities under common control even if their fiscal periods differ by more than 93 days, but requires the recasting of the latest fiscal year to within 93 days and disclosure of amounts excluded or included more than once as a result of the recasting.

434 ASC 810-10-15-11.

435 Regulation S-X prohibits consolidation of subsidiaries of issuers subject to the BHC Act when a divestiture has been made or it is substantially likely that the divestiture will be necessary in order to comply with provisions of the BHC Act.

436 ASC 810-10-15-10a. See also paragraph C2.a of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (August 2001), which eliminated the pre-existing exception from consolidation for subsidiaries under temporary control under ARB No. 51.

437 If an issuer does not eliminate intercompany transactions from its financial statements, Regulation S-X requires it to explain why and how the transactions are treated.

438 See ASC 323-10-35-5a and ASC 810-10-45-1.

439 When separate financial statements of a subset of a consolidated group, such as a parent, subsidiaries, or investees, are presented, Regulation S-X contemplates the elimination of some transactions between the subset of the consolidated group presented in the separate financial statements and other entities in the consolidated group.

440 A subset of a consolidated group that may present separate financial statements includes financial statements of the registrant, certain investees, or subsidiaries.

441 ASC 810-10-45-1.

442 Regulation S-X requires, for interim periods, the presentation of dividends per share on the face of the income statement. Rule 8-03(a)(2) specifically applies to SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP, while Rule 10-01(b)(2) applies to non-SRCs.

443 See ASC 260-10-45-5.

444 Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X allows annual disclosures of changes in stockholders’ equity, including dividends per share amounts, to be provided in a note to the financial statements or in a separate financial statement.

451 ASC 505-10-50-2 requires disclosure of changes in the separate accounts comprising stockholders’ equity (e.g., common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings) during at least the most recent annual fiscal period and any subsequent interim period presented. The proposed amendments would require disclosure of changes in stockholders’ equity for each period presented, which would include comparative periods.

452 Some registrants already include the disclosure required by Rule 3-04 in the Form 10-Q. U.S. GAAP also requires disclosure of significant changes in financial position, like stockholders’ equity, in interim reporting. ASC 270-10-50.

455 See Rule 8-03(b)(6) and Rule 10-01(a)(7) of Regulations S-X. Rule 8-03(b)(6) specifically applies to SRCs and Regulation A issuers in a Tier 2 offering that report under U.S. GAAP, while Rule 10-01(a)(7) applies to non-SRCs.

456 ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.

458 See letters from CAQ; Deloitte; Grant; and PwC. The definition of development stage entities under U.S. GAAP was the same as development stage companies under Regulation S-X.

459 Some insurance companies sponsoring variable annuity contracts for registration on Forms N-3 and N-4 under the Investment Company Act and the Securities Act and some insurance companies offering variable life insurance contracts for registration on Form N-6 under the Investment Company Act and Securities Act prepare financial statements under statutory accounting requirements. These companies are permitted to do so in certain circumstances by the applicable form requirements. Specifically, each of these forms requires financial statements of the insurance company and states that if the insurance company would not have to prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP except for use in the registration statement being filed or other specified registration statements used for variable insurance contracts, then its financial statements may be prepared in accordance with statutory accounting requirements. See Form N-3, Item 28(b), Instruction 1; Form N-4, Item 23(b), Instruction 1; and Form N-6, Item 24(b), Instruction 1. The proposed elimination of Rule 7-02(b) would not change these forms.

461 In 1992 the FASB issued SFAS No. 113, which established that reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses are also assets and may be presented together or separately with other reinsurance receivables. See paragraphs 74 to 76 in SFAS No. 113 and paragraph 76 was codified in ASC 944-20-50-5.

468 See ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement – Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Previously, ASC 225-20-45-2 defined “extraordinary items” as an event or transaction that is unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence, and ASC 225-20-45-3 required separate presentation of the effect of the extraordinary item on the income statement.

469 The proposed amendments apply to the following rules: Rule 1-02(w)(3), Rule 1-02(bb)(1)(ii), Rule 3- 01(c)(2), Rule 3-01(c)(3), Rule 3-15(a)(1), Rule 3A-02(b)(2), Rule 5-03(b), Rule 7-04, Rule 8-03(a)(2), Rule 8-04(b)(3), Rule 9-04, Rule 10-01(b)(4) , Rule 11-02(b)(7), and Instruction 1 to Rule 11-02; Item 10(b)(2) , Item 302(a)(1), and Item 302(a)(3) of Regulation S-K; Securities Act Rule 405, Exchange Act Rule 3a51-1(a)(2)(i)(A)(3); Exchange Act Rule 12b-2; Exchange Act Rule 13a-10(b); and Exchange Act 15d-10(b). The proposed amendments also apply to Form X-17A-5.

470 The proposed definition is consistent with the historical U.S. GAAP definition of “extraordinary items.”

471 While the FASB has eliminated the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP for general purpose financial reporting, the concept of extraordinary expenses is still relevant for investment companies, particularly in disclosure of expense ratios in registration statements. Certain investment company registration forms eliminate extraordinary expenses from expense ratios in the fee table in order to disclose to investors the ongoing level of expense that can be expected. The proposed amendment did not seek to change the requirement that extraordinary expenses be excluded in the fee table and included in footnote disclosure reflecting extraordinary expenses if they would have a material effect.

The Transaction Requirements of Form S-3 no longer relate to securities ratings.

512 Rule 1-02(v) defines the term “share,” while Rule 1-02(w) defines “significant subsidiary.”

513 The definition of “significant subsidiary” in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 are generally intended to be conformed to each other. See, e.g., Technical Amendments to Rules and Forms, Release No. 33-6584 (Jun. 6, 1985) [50 FR 25214 (Jun. 18, 1985)]. Two releases inadvertently changed the definitions of “significant subsidiary” in some, but not all of these three rules, resulting in a lack of conformity. See Acceptance from Foreign Private Issuers of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Without Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, Release No. 33-8879 (Dec. 21, 2007)[73 FR 986 (Jan. 4, 2008)], and Technical Amendments to Rules, Forms, Schedules, and Codification of Financial Reporting Policies, Release No. 33-9026 (Apr. 15, 2009) [77 FR 18612 (Apr. 23, 2009)]. Computational Note 3 to the definition of “significant subsidiary” is only in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X. See Financial Statements and Regulation S-X; Technical Amendments to Rules and Forms, Release No. 33-6612 (Nov. 21, 1985) [50 FR 49529 (Dec. 3, 1985)]. Computational Note 3 relates solely to issues applicable to Regulation S-X and the use of Rule 1-02(w) therein and is not relevant to the uses of the definition in Rule 405 and Rule 12b-2. We are therefore not including Computational Note 3 in Rule 405 and Rule 12b-2.

517 Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)], Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [17 U.S.C. 78c(f)], and Section 2(c) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(c), and 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(c)] require the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act [17 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2)] requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact that the rules would have on competition, and prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act.

518 The number of domestic and foreign private issuers affected by the proposals is estimated as the number of unique companies, identified by Central Index Key (CIK), that filed Forms 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 20-F, and Form 40-F or an amendment thereto with the Commission during calendar year 2017. The estimates for the percentages of SRCs, accelerated filers, large accelerated filers, and non-accelerated filers are based on information from Form 10-K, Form 20-F, and Form 40-F. The estimates for the percentages of foreign private issuers’ basis of accounting used to prepare the financial statements are calculated from the information in Forms 20-F and 40-F. These estimates do not include issuers that filed only initial registration statements during calendar year 2017, which will also be affected by the amendments.

519 This number includes fewer than 25 foreign issuers that file on domestic forms, approximately 100 business development companies, and a portion of the approximately 12,000 investment advisers.

520 Staff determined whether a registrant claimed EGC status by parsing several types of filings (e.g., Forms S- 1, S-1/A, 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, 20-F/40-F, and 6-K) filed by that registrant, with supplemental data drawn from Ives Group Audit Analytics.

521 Approximately 15.9% of foreign private issuers that file on F-forms are Canadian issuers that file on Form 40-F under the multijurisdictional disclosure system. Form 40-F does not require disclosure of large accelerated, accelerated, or non-accelerated filer status. Accordingly, these amounts exclude foreign private issuers that file on Form 40-F.

522 The number of asset-backed issuers is based on the number of unique companies with the SIC code of 6189 that filed Forms 10-K during calendar year 2017.

523 Between June 19, 2015 and December 31, 2017, approximately 182 Regulation A offerings have been qualified. Among these qualified offerings, 57 offerings are Tier I and 125 offerings are Tier II. Over the same time period, approximately 262 Regulation A offering statements have been filed. Among these filed offerings, 94 offerings are Tier I and 168 offerings are Tier II. Withdrawals and post-qualification amendments are excluded. There are annual and semi-annual reporting requirements for Tier II offerings.

524 The number of registered investment companies, excluding business development companies, is estimated from the number of registered active investment companies in EDGAR as of the end of December 2017. The number of business development companies is based on the number of unique companies that filed Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q whose reporting periods end in the last quarter of 2017, adjusted by the number of active business development companies that did not submit such filings and late filers. The number of investment advisers is based on data from Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD).

525 The amendments to Exchange Act Rules 17a-5, 17a-12, and 17h-1T, and Part III of Form X-17A-5 collectively affect approximately 3,883 broker-dealers who must file periodic reports with the Commission.

532 In contrast, there are a few amendments that relocate disclosure from inside the financial statements to outside the financial statements. In this case, the potential economic effects would be opposite to the effects discussed above, reducing costs for issuers, but potentially decreasing benefits to users of the information to the extent that the information is considered less reliable.

This research focuses on a sample of 229 firms that elected disclosure of the postretirement benefit liability in the year(s) prior to adoption of SFAS 106. The authors find that both post-retirement benefit liabilities disclosed prior to adoption of SFAS No. 106, Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions, and those recognized subsequent to adoption significantly contribute to explaining stock prices, thus suggesting that market agents treat disclosed and recognized amounts equivalently.

561 ASC 260-10-45-5 requires disclosure of dividends per share in the notes to the financial statements.

565 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.

566 The paperwork burdens from Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K are imposed through the forms that are subject to the disclosure requirements in both regulations and are reflected in the analysis of these forms. To avoid a Paperwork Reduction Act inventory reflecting duplicative burdens, for administrative convenience we estimate the burden imposed by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K to be a total of one hour for each regulation.

567 See supra note 12.

568 The extension of Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X addresses both overlapping and superseded disclosure issues and is discussed in both Sections III.C.16 and V.B.5 above.

569 In the Proposing Release we included estimates for the minimal paperwork burden increase associated with the proposed amendments to require disclosure of an issuer’s ticker symbol and internet address. Upon further consideration, we are not making a separate burden adjustment for these two amendments. We believe the burdens for these amendments will be mostly incurred upon initial disclosure and not in subsequent periods. In addition, any increases in burden associated with the disclosure of the ticker symbol and internet address would be fully offset by the reduction in burden associated with the elimination of two years’ worth of market price disclosure. Accordingly, we believe the two-hour reduction in burden hours associated with the elimination of the market price disclosure requirement will encompass the combined effect of these related changes.

570 As Form 10-Q is filed for the first three quarters of an issuer’s fiscal year, the annual burden increase is estimated to be 1.5 hours annually. As such, there is no increase to the paperwork burdens associated with preparing annual reports filed on Forms 10-K or 20-F. However, for registration statements filed on Form

571 While this amendment will not impact foreign private issuers that file a Form 20-F as an annual report, it may impact those that file the form to register a class of securities when they would be required to provide interim period disclosures. However, the staff has observed that this occurs so infrequently that we estimate no change in the burden estimate for Form 20-F.

572 The information subject to the amendments discussed in this paragraph is incorporated by reference into Forms S-3 and F-3 and not provided in direct response to a form item requirement. As such, the amendments do not affect the paperwork burdens associated with Forms S-3 and F-3.

573 See supra note 570.

574 Filers of the referenced forms may have to provide interim period financial disclosures in order to comply with Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X. While the timing of the effectiveness of the registration statement or qualification of the offering statement may not trigger the requirement for interim period financial disclosure, we have used the full population of responses for our estimate to be conservative.

575 The portion of registration statements filed on each referenced form that actually registers debt or preference securities varies from year to year. As a result, the numbers in this column are based on staff estimates using data samples obtained from EDGAR.

579 This estimate includes 1,163 reporting companies and 70 Regulation A issuers estimated to be small entities (1,233 = 1,163 + 70). The reporting company small entity estimate is based on staff analysis of XBRL data submitted by filers, other than co-registrants, with EDGAR filings of Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F and amendments filed during the calendar year 2017. The Regulation A small entity estimate is based on staff analysis of Form 1-A data from EDGAR filings of Forms 1-A qualified during the calendar year 2017, excluding issuers in subsequently withdrawn offerings and issuers that became reporting companies during the calendar year 2017.

580 See 17 CFR 270.0-10(a).

581 The estimate of small investment companies is derived from an analysis of data obtained from Morningstar Direct as well as data reported on Forms N-SAR filed with the Commission for the period ending December 31, 2017. The number of small business development companies is derived from data obtained from Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q for reporting periods ended in the last quarter of 2017, adjusted by the number of active business development companies that do not submit such filings and late filers.

582 See 17 CFR 275.0-7.

583 The estimate is based on SEC-registered investment adviser responses to Items 5.F. and 12 of Form ADV.

584 See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d).

585 See 17 CFR 240.0-10(c).

586 This estimate is based on the FOCUS Reports, or “Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single” Reports, which broker-dealers are generally required to file with the Commission and/or SROs pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a-5. The estimate is based on the FOCUS Reports data as of December 31, 2017. The information on Part IIB and Part III filers are not available from this data source.

587 See, e.g., Final Rules: Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Release No. 34-72936 (Aug. 27, 2014) [79 FR 55077 (Sep. 15, 2014)].

588 The amendment discussed in Section V.B.2 that extends the disclosure requirement in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim periods will apply to all issuers, including small entities. As the required information would be readily available from the preparation of the interim financial statements, the Commission expects the additional burdens to be limited. The new disclosure would better facilitate investor understanding of stockholders’ equity, as dividends are distributed from stockholders’ equity. As such, we do not believe it is necessary to scale this specific amendment for small entities.
